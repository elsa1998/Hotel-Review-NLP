address marina to others our booking was very last minute and was handled very efficiently by neha gidwani kohli lifestyle events executive not only did she handle our booking efficiently and patiently we kept changing the booking during the course of the day but she also visited us at our table to ensure that we were properly looked after now thats what i call fabulous hospitalityumair what a guy amazing service went above and beyond made us feel so welcome and chatted to us always asked the right questions i would come back for sure weal was amazing too well done address hotelfrom

something to beholdlocation was excellent for travel 15 mins walk to the beach or 2 mins in a taxiwe were there during ramadan but please dont let this put you off i had my reservations before i went

affordable service was pretty good and on time view over marine was really amazing staff was so friendly and smiling just small comment should be taken in consideration that few staff sometimes

enjoyed staying at the address hotel the room was clean spacious with good quality furniture and fittings shower very good and air conditioning very effective only issue for me was there was no mirror in the actual bedroom we stayed in a suite but there was one in the bathroom and the corridor near the door it is situated right beside the marina with nice views and places to eat very close by it is also beside the mall if you want to do some shopping and even has a waitrose inside swimming pool is a great size and the loungers around it are in an excellent position for having the sun most of the day sometimes the music was a bit loud for total relaxation but nothing major we paid extra to have access to the executive lounge which we found to be very handy staff in the hotel excellent and very friendly my husband and i would love to return to this hotel at some point loved the hospitality of mr umair  recommend you all to visit the place  loved the view we planned to visit for an hour but

doing great the location was very good i recommend the hotel 100 the staff is very friendly very clean hotel just great it is more than a 5 star hotel i really liked the pool too i will definitely come againstayed at the address marina for 4 nights from the 25th may we had a deluxe double with fantastic views of the pool and the marina room was smartly designed with all the extras ironhairdryer etc you might need for your stay you could even bathe with a view of the marina breakfast in the morning has everything you might want to set you up for the day plenty of choice and excellent quality the staff were all very pleasant and knowledgeable we booked tickets to the burj khalifa through the concierge and again he was knowledgeable and took no time in getting us booked in at the restaurant the hotel has a fantastic pool and is busy during the day if you leave it too late on in the day to get sun beds you could be disappointed at night the pool area turns into a restaurant and bar we didnt dine here but heard good things about shades the hotel is directly attached to the marina mall so very convenient for shopping and the nearby restaurants and bars at pier 7 the location is roughly a 10 minute walk from the beach where there is more shopping and more choices of restaurants for me the hotel was in a place that was convenient and close enough for the things that me and my wife wanted to do maybe for those with young families it could be too much of a trek to the beach and back i would definitely go back to address marina we stayed here for a couple of nights after our cruise from the moment you arrive you will love it the staff are wonderful they upgraded us due to birthday to a beautiful suite it was definitely the most beautiful hotel i have stayed in first time in dubai this is perfect location and the rooms are impressive they left a beautiful birthday cake for us which was delicious we used the club lounge i am not sure of the staff name but the gentleman who greeted us and served us was amazing they cannot do enough for you i cannot wait to return to this hotel this is definitely the only place i will stay in dubai breakfast in mazina restaurant was superb the chefs and staff are lovely such a wide variety of food served here hotel is stunning the pool is lovely we used it once and staff here got us loungers and was very helpful even though it was busy i promise you will not be disappointed its the best we loved our eid vacation here the hotel has easily got the best cityscape pool in all of dubai and is in swift walking distance of the

              " 'nice hotel for the family everywhere in the hotel you will feel welcomed by all the staff are friendly and do their best to make your stay nice and comfortable the rooms are renovated and clean  it is one of the best hotels in dubai i would like to thank mr mohammed zaki the team leader of reservation who helped us in the reservation and explain professionally about the hotel rooms  suites and the offers he does his best to make our stay comfortable and relplies to our inquiries promptly also mr vijesh kumar at vip services who was friendly and professional and kindly helped us in check in and check out  also mr emmanuel oppong at housekeeping who does his best everyday to make sure that evert thing is ok and well arranged  so thank you allvery unrealized expensive price for every things that are unfortunately not comparable to any high prestigious places in the world 4000 dkk for 20 pictures we already paid the full entering price which is about 800 dkk for one personwe were here last august on a 9 day family trip to uae and mauritiuswe had our last night here at the atlantis really really wished we had more days here everything from the waterpark to the food from staff to the rooms was beyond perfect couldnt get any better if i come next time to dubai definitely the atlantis would be my first choice to staythe atlantis palm is by far one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever been to traveling in over 10 countries the atlantis has a truly special interior however its such a shame that a beautiful hotel like this has such horrible customer service employees at check in made the whole process so terrible we werent welcomed friendly even after upgrading to the imperial club it was almost as if we were non existent they dont seem to care about concerns because they continue to ignore you and move on to something else its sad to spend all your money at a place and expect to have a happy time i personally feel you can spend money at a cheaper place and have amazing customer service that will do anything to make you happy i highly recommend to spend your money at another hotel and just come to the atlantis to visit not to stay its definitely not worth the money its just all about the name 11th visit its still an amazing place notably the aquarium and water parknew wavehouse had a great atmosphere with rusty a great member of staff however arrived to closed imperial lounge not directed anywhere stumbled upon alternative out of hrs check in long waits hot and bothered post flight no offer of a drink or a flannel  families waiting for rooms told rooms not ready or available we then get same message from one overworked staff member running around asking for managers to assist her it was chaos for a large hotel that use to make you feel individual not a number we had emailed in advance several times and usual get a fab room not this time put in west tower for a night and compensated with credit to spend in resort not ideal felt we had to buy things we didnt need following day advised we could move to our preferred tower and room by 34 pm so half packed we waited very patiently in water park etcroom advised was in east tower great we thought but  on arrival smelt of smoke and damp rang housekeeping who sent atomiser which helped given its our 11th time no upgrade ok room but not the corner room we use to get  we are here for a week normally ten days so felt a big let down no towels animals nice touch by staff previously it was hit and miss for turn down and no fruit all of which existed on previous trips one year we a large box of chocolates and crystal key ring but nothing  as recognition of all our visitsall now feels a bit loud and brash and agree with comments about kids and food areas hands everywhere seafood night still good but smaller fayre nice meal in locatelli but you need top up supplements for most good restaurantsatlantis not sure we will be back given price feel of place and slipping standards imperial ok as quieter for breakfast but evening and lunch much we did not use to n peak times too many peoplesuggest you review what you are offering if families only then great but coupled who use to visit will not if you continue as you arewe had a great time the water park is fantastic but its a little too hot this time of year we were half board and the food was amazing we arrived at 2am and the check in was a nightmare the staff are very focused on persuading you to upgrade which we did they didnt provide us with any information about the hotel or our upgrade but we were so tired we just wanted to get to our room the room was nice but small and there were no coffee or tea facilities in the room we had to wait around 30 mins for them to bring another bed and bedding for the sofa bed we arrived so late it would have been better if these were already prepared the wave room arcade is great fun but aside from that theres not much to do in the evening as a family overall we had a great time we just got back from our week stay at atlantis as a couple i had visited the hotel before for the water park and restaurants but have previously stayed with jumeirah we altered our booking from jumeriah to stay at atlantis for a change after seeing good reviews and always wondering what staying there is like the pool was lovely especially as the heat was crazy but the pool and sunbeds did get extremely busy staff always help you find beds if there are none available though all the staff were great and polite especially in kaleidoscope we both found that the gentleman at checkout was very rude which was disappointing right at the end of our stay there was also no help with the transfer and we were having to walk up to men and ask if they were there for us which the transfer driver brought up and said is always a problem with this hotel we enjoyed the free use of the water park and aquarium and enjoyed going to the wavehouse arcade within the hotel the hotel was lovely and cooled which was nice after being outside we had an ocean club room which was lovely and a lot more modern than we expected with lovely views of the sea the cleaner was great and constantly checking if there was anything we needed the rooms were not very soundproof at all and we did have trouble sleeping most nights due to a loud family next door this could be as they were connecting rooms overall we enjoyed our stay but found the halfboard deal disappointing  there were only a few restaurants that did not require extra charges and a couple were outside only so were too hot to eat at this time of year when we tried them breakfast was lovely every day and all meals were all good  we mostly ate at kaleidoscope the hotel was stunning and we did have a lovely visit however we would choose jumeriah over atlantis next time as the overall experince was much better there atlantis was more suited for young children than couples holidaysduring the trip we did a speedboat tour with xclusive tours which was great and the burj khalifa fountain boat trip which was also recommended taxis were available 247 out the front of the hotel which was useful as we did not hire a car great hotel but service has to improve as i had to wait long periods of time in ques for check incheck out had to wait 90 minutes for luggage to arrive in room same about in room service had to wait and call few times for servicesit was greatthe receptionist was rudenice poolexcellent in terms of cleninesswas a nice visityou should keep the facilities freeit was out of the worldthe view was goodthe hotel was good would recommend this hotel to my friends and family members who did not visitrequire to improve room to be comfortablebed not comfortablebathroom with less lights the rate of the room not matching the room comfortablei am not recommend to stay in this hotel if we compare with the ratedother hotel batter than this with very good priceas i confirmed room in the top floor during my confirmation time they given me 2 floor during check in and saying that all their rooms are booked this made me unhappy during my stay so please assign rooms also during confirmation of bookinghaving stayed 18 month ago i had high hopes for this stay sadly the entire stay was one disappointment after another i upgraded to the imperial club having done so previously however it would seem that this upselling is offered to the majority of the hotel with queues out of the door during each serving with people waiting 30 minutes for a premium  exclusive service i contacted the management to discuss how disappointing this was on our first night but despite being told theyd contact me im still waiting the waiting staff were polite and helpful but there simply werent enough for the volume of people in the club lounge the wait for a drink was as long as the wait to get in the management of the lounge stood huddled sharing jokes rather than assisting their colleagues or speaking to disgruntled guests there was a rather shambolic incident at the pool whereby after paying my bill i was then told the bill had been incorrect and the waiting staff insisted on giving me a new bill and taking drinks awaythe hotel is beginning to look quite dated and garish but one we chose to stay in having received such wonderful service last time however this was not the case this time around it seems that the priority for the management is number of guests paying high prices rather than ensuring guests have an experience that is reflective of the price theyre paying given the sheer number of excellent hotels in dubai there are far better options for the priceservice was good but should have informed the guest while check in of any matters that affect the stay for eg if construction work is happening inform guest or allocate rooms accordingly aqua venture was very good  staff was courteous break fast area was manged well dont let the heat of the july sun stop you from going book the executive club lounge enjoy the lunch and hit the pool afterwards there is much to do in this air conditioned paradise  make the most of the facilitiesthe hotel has the best location in nice and a breathtaking view friendly staff go out of their way to make your stay perfect do spend the extras for a room with a balcony  it is so worth it thank youi had visited dubai and we had planned to stay at the atlantis for 2 nights this is my 2nd visit to the hotel it is same as before same high class service the aura of atlantis is different we were two families and we all enjoyed the stay a lot the rooms were always very clean and a lot of effort was made by the supoort staff for it they were always ready to help u gr8 stay thereatlantis is best place to stay with family my 8 years and 9 years old kid love the water park aquarium and shopping at avenue we ate at hakkasan chinese restaurant staff are awesome manager and server are very friendly i will advise every one to visit hakkasan restaurant at atlantis palmshort vacation in atlantis was very nice  we enjoined the activities  food  and the stay very nice experience which helps you to relax and forget the routine work hassle it also recharge your energy to resume your routine scheduleservice was exceptional the staff were very courteous professional and willing to assist the resort architecture is unique our room was clean tastefully furnished and had everything that we neededa beautiful hotel for families but also seems to cater for adults they some of the best restraunats i have been to except the ossannia which was over priced and did not feel welcomei would advise to book the imperial rooms as you get entrance to the imperial lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea and happy hour in the evening a place to be when u r in dubai comfortable room with cooperative staff aquarium n water park energise u pub restaurants n shopping m many more under one roof make ur stay worthy delicious food n its interior is icing on the cakerelax n have fun enjoyyy the stay alotconsidering the hotel was at full capacity we never had to hunt for sun lounger or reserve with towels the waiter service at the beach and pools were brilliant will be back as soon as possible many thanks atlantis i spent 2 nights in atlantis with my two kids they were super happy for the location water park and additional activities included in the hotel also the bus service to the emirates mall is very convenient and giving you the way to go in the city without any stressa fabulous stay at the atlantis we come to dubai regularly at least once or twice a year having tried lots of amazing hotels in dubai i have to say we throughly enjoyed our stay at the atlantisthere are a few things to however bear in mind this hotel is massive and is primarily geared to families due to the sheer size of this place you will definitely not get a personalised feel in this place in fact there are people constantly everywhereif you go to this hotel with this in mind you will enjoy it but you will need to come here expecting it to be very busywe arrived early from our flight from the uk and our rooms werent ready until 200pm however you are able to start using the hotel facilities we made our way to the hospitality lounge where we helped ourselves to some tea and some lovely cookiesthe buffet restaurants kaleidoscope and saffron were great the amount of people flooding in these restaurants for breakfast and dinner was massive but the hotel staff were doing a fabulous job to get everyone seated as soon as they could we didnt experience any queuing as we went for dinner early and at breakfast we avoided the peak times however we did see long queues to enter the buffet restaurants there was a fabulous spread of food laid out you can always find something to eat even for my fussy child some of the food was very tastythe staff at the hotel were very friendly and made a big effort to ensure we had a great staythe aquarium was great as was the royal pool only if you can get your head round to the fact there are people everywhere the security in the hotel was very apparent there were security guards at all entrances and at all the lifts and near the shops our room was in the tower near the aquarium the pool had lots of lifeguards which was reassuringwe had a refurbished room the size of the room was great not claustrophobic at all and felt very spacious the room was extremely clean a special mention to our housekeeper pavan dasari he couldnt have been more helpful always greeted us with smiles he was very attentive and he made sure everything was fine with our room the room cleanliness was impeccable it was these special touches that the staff made that made our stay really enjoyable and memorable pavan dasari is a real asset to this hotel he certainly made our stay comfortable and enjoyableyou get access to the waterpark he went there once but the wave pool and lazy river was closed as someone was sick in there and they had to drain the water out we left immediately and didnt return as my daughter who is 6 years old didnt want to go back we were in and out of the waterpark straight away due to the fact we only went there to go on the lazy river and the wave pooli used the gym which was great but didnt use the spa but it looked lovelyto sum it up a great hotel with fabulous staff expect it to be very busy at all times as it is geared towards families there will be lots of children everywhere if you dont mind this then this is a fabulous place to staystayed here for 1 week with family had a suite picked up at airport go vip check in so smooth huge room all been updated the staff always speak nothing is to much trouble foods great we had the free drinks 5pm to 7pm this was great the best hotel ive been love it fantastic hotel everything is perfect in this place good place for couples families or holidays with friends the staff is very kind great activities provided aqua park dolphins diving jetskifacility is great staff is awesome in person for the  dont rely on internet booking you will get repeated personalized canned statements via email horrible experience to start the vacation being forgotten at the airport hope for the manager to contact you but dont rely on itwe arrived at the atlantis in an emerites car the door was opened and we were guided into the hotel lobby our luggage had already been taken care of we proceeded to the private lounge where we were given a glass of juice to refresh us as we sat in the plush seats to check in we were then escorted to the lifts and up to the room where the very kind gentleman explained all of the features of the 2 bedroom regal suite we had selected to stay in that had set the scene for the rest of our 5 night break in dubai and the atlantis all i can say is that this place truly exceeded all of our expectations and we felt like royalty from the moment we arrived to the moment we left food service cleanliness facilities and friendliness of all members of the team were perfect thanks again atlantis team for a holiday we will treasure in our hearts until we return again very soon stuart gouldingcheck in was an absolute nightmare it was like a market place and it took forever i will suggest that the hotel make sure that all hands to pump during the check in period 3pm to help clear the queue quickly there is nothing like waiting in line for an hour after a long haul flight and you just want to have a shower and sleepjust stayed at the atlantis again and wasnt disappointed the rooms have been refreshed there is a new imperial lounge could do with being larger to cope with the demand the general spa facilities are no longer included as part of the package shame food is labelled for common intolerances however if you let the staff know of your specific needs  we required gluten free meals the chefs visit you at your table and prepare food just for you a big thank you to chefs joseph and abhilashhad an awesome stay at atlantis celebrating my birthday great service wonderful and professional staff room was massive and clean would definitely recommend this place had a dolphin encounter to celebrate my birthday awesome experience after a great break last year with my partner we decided to return with our teenage daughter as a treat at the end of her exams again there was an air conditioned car ready and waiting as soon as we arrived to take us to atlantis unfortunately there was an issue with our room at check in and being tired from the journey we were not happy although every effort was made to accommodate us but at 100am it was difficult to see this we got a temporary room and after a good nights sleep the following day whilst we enjoyed the water park the whole issue was resolved this minor issue was swiftly forgotten as we enjoyed the splendour of atlantis there have been many changes since our previous visit all good to maintain the atlantis as a first class hotel in dubai the imperial suite has been improved to great effect the wavehouse is a great place to spend an evening and the rooms refurbished again the food was great the staff friendly and helpful and facilities excellent we cannot recommend the atlantis highly enough our teenage daughter loved it and whilst we dont like going anywhere twice we are now planning our third visit enjoyoverall love this place but some staff need further training in customer care ten years we have visited each year and love the place just dissatisfied with the breakfast and dinner service  having to ask for tea and mugs and spoons more than 56 times no doubt property is excellent but management is utterly disgustingtook us 5 hours to chk in poor room service  pools were closed by 7 pm wen actually weather got bit pleasant food quality n variety is not doubt vry gudgreat for kids and adults alike this is our third fourth time to dubai for stop overs my husband wanted to try this hotel and it was an eye opener and huge though it is expensive to stay and purchase food etc but worth it great place to visit definitely on the bucket list experience but be prepared to spend a lot of money as it is very expensive and many things are highly over priced would recommend for any type of holiday eg couples or familyatlantis at the top if you want spend your holidays in dubaiall the facilities are extremely clean accessible and amazing the staff is kind and very well prepared and organized to give you all the information you needwe arrived tired and hungry as we had travelled overnight from london greeted by hassan who said we could go to the hospitality lounge for a teacoffee whilst waiting for our room on arrival at the so called hospitality suite we were met with a very unpleasant lady who made us feel very unwelcome  just said no coffee or tea today after going back to inform hassan of this we were allowed to have a breakfast instead of our last morning which seemed very fair apart from this our stay was absolutely fabulous our cleaner was a lovely man who couldnt do enough for us it was my birthday whilst there and there was a lovely cake waiting for us in the room very kind a fab place and a wonderful experience loved atlantis my daughter son and grandaughter loved their dolphin experience the half board option is superb fave restaurant was amanya the lebanese restaurant wonderful  stayed at the resort for three nights and upgraded to the imperial club i have nothing adverse to say about the atlantis my time here was absolutely amazing the service that we experienced from our transfer from the airport to check in and meals was amazing the benefits of the imperial club were unbelievable and we were made to feel like royalty i couldnt believe that amount of food treats and drinks available at the imperial club and really there was no necessity to go anywhere else to eat if you didnt want we ate breakfast daily at saffrons and i have never seen a buffet with so many options we were totally blown away with every aspect of our stay and will definitely be returning the staff couldnt do enough for you and were brilliant i can not recommend the atlantis highly enough do yourself a favour and upgrade to the imperial club worth every cent in my opinionthe standard of this hotel is not like what we expect as this is atlantis this is in muslim country but wondering there was no muslim shower in the toilets and room furniture and the setting is very ordinary nothing as according to namelimited value for the money the lounges access is way to overcrowded and many families misunderstood the concept of club accessmany times we actually felt sorry for the staff as they couldnt handle the situation and looked like the wanted to give up property is well placed near seaa perfect place to be with family and friends lost chamber and water park are places where u can spend quality time with kids  dinner we opted for continental and was fabulous only concern was we have to wait for 4 hours for check in around 17hrs we got the rooma distinguished hotel in its construction location and luxury lobby amazing experience in the big aqua park very clean and friendly staff the rooms are not as luxury as the hotel we had dinner it was very nice and valuable breakfast was not as expected we had a great experience during our stay at atlantisthe water park was amazing with great rides and facilitiesthe swimming pool and beach was excellentroom had an excellent viewstaff were really very friendly helpful always smiling and courteousroom service was amazingly quickwe had food and drinks in bread street kaleidoscope and saffron all of these restaurants had amazing food with lots of varietyoverall an excellent experience that we will remember during our entire lifenothing better than this from reception area to room beaches water park all things are so perfect every staff were so humble and caring best and perfect life time experience for us thanx to all staff for making our stay sop perfect best thing is ours palm view room staying at atlantis the palm was an amazing getaway the helpfulness and polite nature of the staff as well as the upkeep of the entire resort was impeccable well done atlantis in keeping it world class this is a busy hotel and not for couples it is a great family hotel with a huge array of activities for kidsbut would not advise for couples if you want a relaxing break on the plus side the restaurants are top draw in particular nobuexcellent facilities and service many activities for kids friendly and helpful staff good food even though quite expensive imperial treatment worth the extra pay we will visit again as kids are so excitedwow wow wow i have just returned from the most amazing week at the atlantis at the very start of july  absolutely gutted to be home atlantis cannot be faulted they provided every service we signed up for we booked a king room under the imperial club package  everything from the room the services received from housekeeping waiters security was phenomenal i was a bit worried after reading recently a lot of reviews which werent good reviews however i do feel after witnessing some very rudestuck up people i believe that there was clearly a bit much being asked of the hotel  services i research literally everything prior to travelling and i would only ever write a true review noted below are pros  cons  tips the hotel could possibly take note of for future prosevery single request i added to my booking regarding palm view room away from works currently being carried out  newly refurbished were met we arrive at 8am and check in isnt officially until 3pm we were invited to use all facilities hotel doesnt need to allow this as youve not officially paid for that morningday until after 3pm a text at 1130am to say our room was ready luggage was in room before wed even reached the room imperial club benefits of happy hoursnacks is 100 worth it we didnt use the benefits everyday but even for the times we did use it was worth it we had bottles upon bottles of prosecco and never paid for them due to being included in the happy hour service the servers in the imperial are second to none checking chairs to ensure ladiesgents in their outfits wasnt sitting on wet chairs from afternoon tea service security around the whole building was great not that ive ever felt at risk in dubai ever but it was crazy seeing how secure they were there water park included was brilliant as previously i paid to enter and was around 60 for 1 visit per person the housekeeping are obsessed with cleaning your room for you which surprised me as other staff in other hotels love it when you dont want your room serviced i liked how they wanted to clean for you even if you were in the room or if you could give them a time to come back was really nice to feel like they wanted you to have a fresh bed to come home to after dinner room serviced twice a daythe whole building smells phenomenal no idea what they use but wow the smell is incredible the service included in imperial includes pick up drop off from airport we didnt require pick up but used drop off and the driver was brilliant on time taught up some dubai knowledge as we headed to airport  was extremely helpful breakfast selection was huge imperial club do a quieter smaller buffet which i noticed on the reviews had a lot of complaints about how it didnt have much of a selection i think some people are missing the point of it  its there to be a quieter option and the imperial lounge isnt as big as the restaurants which have the buffet breakfasts its perfect for something light to eat if you want a 4 course breakfast then go to the other restaurants to eatyou dont have to give a card on file if you dont want to charge to room we never and no issues we never wanted to charge anything to room or touch mini bar massive towels are available for use at beach or pool for no extra charge housekeeping provide you with as much bottled 500ml water as you need  stock up take them to the pool in morning as the refreshments bar doesnt open until 10am by then your water will be warm and youll need to get some more consthere is a lot of travellers there who are extremely rude and their children have no manners many times whilst queuing for the food in the imperial lounge people were allowing their children anything from the starting age of say 3 to help themselves and this was a problem children were skipping queues touching food with their hands and putting it back screaming at the top of their lungs and rudely interrupting the staff as they were talking to other guests this was outwith the hotels control after all it is absolutely up to the parents of these children to be supervising their kids the hotel i do think could introduce a policy where they do not allow children to help themselves to food they should be supervised i have no issues with familieschildren on holiday at all i do have issues with them not having manors and being unsupervised there were also so many well behavedsupervised children the charges for drinks soft are extortionate even with half board half board doesnt included soft drinks and we had a bill for 58 aed for 2 300ml cans of juice that is over 1250 crazy take water in your bag i think that was very steep as you can see the cons bar 1 is out with the hotels control i think the hotel could be more strict on the children running around the food areas touching food which would definitely help one girl who was around 4 in saffron evening buffet was at the desert counter and removed with her fingers licking her fingers each time she removed sweeties from every cake on the stand and walked off her mother was too busy deciding what she wanted to eat to have even noticed her daughter wandered off scary enough that your allowing your eyes to come off her for a start but to be touching all the food thats out for everyone else is terrible the hotel was amazing the staff were incredibly helpful and nice to deal with the pool and beach was gorgeous everything was amazing and i had one of my best holidays ever  that is 80 down to the atlantis for providing us with such phenomenal service i will 100 be back thank you i was so excited to stay at the atlantis and on the whole the hotel exceeded my expectations but there were just a few things that prevent me rating it a 5firstly we decided to arrive on a late night flight rather than and early morning flight so that we could wake up refreshed and ready to enjoy what was on offer however the hotel was busy and i got put in a holding room for the night and advised to visit check in the next day to change rooms the holding room was not good it smelt damp and had paint all over the windows and dust sheets covering the balcony i did know work was underway on the hotel but i didnt expect to be put in a room that was part of the work we did get moved to a much better room but it took me 3 trips to the check in area to sort this out i dont consider this service 5 star and i could see other guests who had arrived that day being given rooms whilst i was still waitingwe opted for the imperial club and so glad we did afternoon tea and evening drinks were excellent i would recommend anyone to opt for this if budgets allowthe waterpark was great as well and having free entry meant we could go early morning before the crowds arrived and queues got big i highly recommend getting the pool socks as the ground is extremely hotwe had half board and this was a really good option with plenty of choice the buffet breakfast in both kaleidoscope and saffron were plentiful and had more than you could imagine asia republic and the tbh burger did a fantastic meal on the half board offer the worst meal we had was unfortunately in bread street kitchen where we had to pay a supplement starter and main were great but my dessert of panacotta was like rubber wavehouse was fun and we enjoyed an evening having a few drinks and dancingall in all we had a great time despite the few issues and none of them would stop me going back or recommending it forget the hype even if you have the regal suite its still a noise hotel with shared pool have stayed in much better quality 5 star hotels in dubai and orlando avoid if you want a classier or calmer experience if youve got annoying kids this will suit you as a family experience the hotel is in itself like a mini city where you could spend all your daythe infrastructure is superb and unmatched to any other 5 star propertiesthe private beachthe royal pool were my favourite spots to spend timeas a inhouse guest you get complimentary unlimited access to aquaventurethe waterpark and the lost chambersthe aquarium which is quite coolas for the food i tried kaleidoscope and saffron and they both had a lavish and super large buffeti found the taste of the dishes quite normalno wow factor sort of thingthe rooms were awesome and beautifully designed with attractive carpetsthe dolphin bay was the thing that i loved the mostoverall i just wanna say that on my next visit to dubai im gonna spend a lot of time in atlantis playing with the dolphinswould definitely recommend this hotel our stay was awesome from start to finish cant wait to return there is so much to do and see from the hotel itself the aquarium waterpark swimming with dolphinsi stay in atlantis 4 nights i think need more than 4we enjoyed the pool sea restaurants and aquariumstaff very helpful especially topian in aqua venture highly recommended for family with children ',\n",
              " 'its not a fancy hotel and its not a real hostel its just okay for travelers who dont want to waste a lot of money for the luxury hotel its place with comfortable custom beds and very good breakfast polite staff soooo kind girls at the reception and cheerful housekeepers  its nice place to meet people to cooperate with someone and go to safari tour together nice area near the metro aaand lifehack you can take free bus from the nearest hotel to go to the beach also at the reception u can take free metro map and use fast wifi to download wifi mapgreat hostel with cheap prices you can go way cheaper than 100 if you select the 68 person room it is super chill like most good hostels you get space for yourself and a pretty big bed with a board that you can sit on staff on the other hand was very nice and morning breakfasts were always very welcoming and family like you can also play ps4 with your mates any time you feel like highly recommend this placei dont have to say much about this place its just nice you know that kind of places where you feel like its just nice to be backpacker 16 is like that the managers are professional and helpful the location is just right cause it is pretty close to all the popular places the environment is chill and cooli was staying in this hostel for a week and i didnt like it the service was very bad and attitude as well and in the apartment was really dirty and there was cockroaches and i cannot sleep because every time in the room there are cockroaches and sometimes you can see it on youre bed in the shower everywhere if the managers really want to have a good hostel they should take care about the apartments where the tourists sleeping actually you can take better a room in hotel and lose a little bit more money but without all this issues that are in hostelthe hostel does not have any structure to be a hostel it is just a bunch of apartments that someone made a hostel the common area is just a tiny apartment turned into a common area there is no place to eat breakfast it is dirty disorganized and crowded there are clothes and belongings either guests or from the hostel itself everywhere there is no space for anything breakfast is awful there was no coffee and no space to eathave i said it was dirty a guy puked in the middle of the night 430am and the dirty remained there until late morning ok maybe not the hostels fault but when i decided to leave the staff didnt refunded me for the days i didnt stay this is ridiculous stay away from this place you can get a cheap hotel where you will be able to sleep and have a good breakfast for just a little morewelcoming and service by very professional and friendly people they really create home atmosphere here comfortable bed with enough space around every day cleaning and nice breakfast living room always available to watch movie or just make some new friends provided all the things what traveller needs the staff is very friendly room was neat up and ready for me to relax and sleep upon arrival i was very happy about that the hostel is near to all amenities i needed ie metro station and hyper supermarket making my stay very comfortableim staying here and last reviews were initially scared away but dubai is not cheap city and here is on of the reasonable option because of the price and the location near the metro pros free high speed wifi amazing breakfast rooftop access helpful staffnons small common area i stayed here for 3 night while having my short stay in dubai walking distance form the metro station and they also can arrange you for the tour activity with reasonable price friendly reception good place for a short staythe staff are super friendly and helpful i especially appreciated the clean and large bathrooms great breakfast and fun conversations with other guests i was also amazed that a hostel would have a pool and a gym i would definitely recommend staying herewe stayed 3 nights in a mixed 8bed dorm dorm and bathroom were very clean and we had access to private cooking area  fridge free tea coffee and juice in the common room the included breakfast was lovely very friendly staff as wellconveniently located about 7min walk from metro station internet citythis place is like 7 mins away from dubai internet metro station it has a wonderful breakfastwith wonderful working staffvery respectful on on every level and wonderful enviroment clean with netflix tv and shisha defenitly is the place to stay for enhanced experience in dubaiall in all its a nice place with very helpful and friendly staff breakfast is awesome fresh watermelon toast cereal nutella and omlette coffee and tea are available 247 the gym is alright bit the toof top pool was closed due to maintenance quite a big con is the lack of security as the main entrance as well as side entrance are always open and the doors to the dorms with lockers cannot be locked no locks this hostel was great it was 10mins from the metro and had a pool and gymthe rooms were nice with a balcony and the curtains gave good privacythe staff who worked here were incredibly helpfulonly tip is dont book there safari as you can get it for a lot cheaper else wherei came to know recently that dubai has hostels while seating in a coffee shop with my bestie one day 5 minutes from my place they said im a go getter person dont you think i just locate them and drop by to check i went i got lost i wandered i found it guys they do exist and it was an absolutely professional great staff they just showed me all their rooms almost in the middle of the night so they have 6beds in a room 50 15 aed per night option and an executive room  189  50 aed per night  which is not bad at all it has a double bed and own attached bathroom a shared kitchen with another private room what i liked about this hostel the staff they do surprise me with the sincere hospitality and pro approach though j told them i just want to have a look and might not stay there is an option for a breakfast for another 20 aed 6a clean and safe place for backpackers in dubai thanks to olya andrew and jean for being a great hosts guysthis was my first time in dubai so i cant compare this with other hostel in the area i arrived past midnight there is no clear signage to the reception and the door was closed so i was a bit lost it is located within walking distance to metro station which is a good thing and the breakfast is value for moneyi am currently backpacking south east asia but dubai was my first stop accommodation is expensive in this part of the world but finding an affordable hostel was easyat the time i thought all hostels are little hut bungalows by the beach blame mu enthusiasm for bali instagram posts so i was shocked to find it was on one floor of a 14 story building the hostel is located in a red light district you wont see any uncouth activities going on but i saw loads of passport photo sized pictures of women advertising themselves and signs saying no loiteringi arrived quite late at night but there were staff there to check me in you are given a security card to open your roomthe bed was comfortable and i had a privacy curtaini was given a small locker to keep my valuables in i kept my backpack under my bedthe hostel serves a very nice breakfast so nice that it skewed my later expectations of hostel breakfasts think sausage omelettes toast with loads of spreads fruit juices and hot drinks you have to pay extra for breakfast thoughthe showers could be improved there is a bathtub come shower that was very dirty but its ok if you have flip flopsthe social aspect was very good i met a lot of people on the first night who i still talk to there are always people going out at night to the nearby bars and clubs everyday is ladies night in dubai overall it was not a bad baptism to backpacking or to dormsvery friendly to your wallet easy transport with metro shops and restaurants nearbyalso esy to grab taxi if needed clean roomsonly i wish number of rest rooms were more it could be difficult to access restroom given number of guests they havetime to timethis hostel was great i slept in the girls dorm bed was sooo comfortable and private and nice blanket you can use the kitchen you can use a gym and pool and wow the breakfast is incredible soooo many nice things but the best is the stuff they are so friendly and helpful with every question got a free ride to the airport without asking thank you a lot again great stay i planned to stay this hostel in a short term basis when i joined my new job they provide excellent and supportive services free breakfast and wifi a lot of different things the crews working there are nice and friendly very flexible so i decided to stay longer until now they provide both daily and monthly options if you have a plan to visit the city in few days then go for hostel its highly recommended there are car service and desert safari tour too you can easily book with them anytime rooms are cleaned twice a day as i can remember everything in the kitchen is provided if you wanna cook for yourself grocery and taxi atm are nearby very convinient for you especially there are several bars next to it easy night lifei stayed in hostel 4 days it was amazing time i love this hostel girls managers was beautiful kind and sey i recommend this hostel if u come dubai also in hostel you can go gym swimming pool thats really nice pleasei checked in late at around 10pm after a long busy day all i wanted was to get into my bed and have a nice rest but no even at 130am the noise from the kitchen area kept me awake i thought that was bad enough but then i was woken at 5am and 6am to a man coming into my room and talking to the girl on the bottom bunk very loudly its a female only dormthe room was an absolute state the girl below clearly lived there and had taken over the small amount of room that was there including the whole wardrobe and the window ledge and the whole space under the bed i had nowhere for my things i also had no plug for my devices even though the website stated that every bed has a plug and a night light thats a lie the whole area was a mess the floor was awful i never took my shoes off the final straw for me was housekeeping trying to break into the bathroom when i was getting a showerthe bathroom was also a mess stuff everywhere no toilet roll until someone put it back there in the morning floor was soaking i kept my flip flops on to get in my interrupted showeri complained to the staff and they told me they had already had complaints about my room and the girl living there i asked for my second night to be refunded as i wouldnt be staying they refusedthis is the most pathetic hostel i have ever stayed in and i travel alot i would rather sleep on the street in the heat than stay here againthe only good thing about this hostel was the wifii never even made it to the pool or gym or breakfast i just wanted to get out of there',\n",
              " 'only had two days here to break the long trip home to sydney from madrid but long enough to see the main sites this hotel is very traditional in design and room layout rooms are spacious and very well air conditionedthank goodness great to be next to the waterfrontthe adjoining restaurant serves wonderful arabic meals at good prices we loved their fresh lemon juice with mintrefreshingonly negativetaxis can not find it we spent almost 40 minutes getting there and only 20 to get back tell the driver to drop you at al ghubaiba metro stationits a 2 minute walk from there towards the waterfrontps the metro here is fast cheap and easy to get around use it instead of taxis to get to the burj etcperfect location near creak boat metro bus stop and carrefour beautiful surrounding  good price the price of room changes very fast noisy bedmodest breakfast the location of air condition canalfinal word i chose this hotel because it is near al ghubaiba bus station  abu dhabi busstayed there for an extended weekend we loved the hotel and the real heritage experience  the location is great directly at the creek and near the old souq metro also nearby so get around quickly and easily the room was large and clean staff nice and helpful also the price is quite reasonable compared to the other large hotels although the oasis beach tower is our favorite in dubai we would as well pick this guest house again  recommendedmy husband and i stayed in dubai at the barjeel for 2 nights on a quick layover the hotel was perfect and i wouldnt hesitate to stay there again if i were to return to dubai location was great staff were helpful room was large and the breakfast included was delicious we felt the barjeel was fantastic value for what we gotwe stayed at the hotel with our 10 month old baby the hotel has a nice arabic charm which separates it from big internationally stadardized hotels the staff was friendly and the room offered a lot of space the restaurant offers tasty food and the location of the hotel besides the canal invites for a walk a metro station is nearby so if your luggage is not too heavy the best way to get to the hotel is via metrosituation is excellent for exploring dubai  200m to the metro and a taxi rank and not much more to the abra station to cross the creek to the gold and spice souks however be aware that taxi drivers may not know of this hotel and that closest access by car is 200m walk which might matter if carrying luggage in the extreme heat my room was fine and everything essential worked but a little rough slats on bed sprung and decor crude staff very nice but no one serviced the room in my three night staywhen we first arrived our taxi driver didnt know how to get to the hotel there is no street infront and you must walk with your suitcases to find the hotel this is the only negative thing and if you know this it is much easier the hotel is right by the metro station and so close to the abra dock we were easily able to explore even staying there for 24 hours the reason i give this hotel 5 stars is because of their amazing customer service we were accommodated with arriving early at 6am we had to pay a fee of 37 us but it was the best money we spent as we had been traveling for almost a month and we were ready to rest they provided us our room helped carry our bags and also accommodated us with a very early morning breakfast on the next day when we departed they allowed us to have our continental breakfast at 630am  we were greeted by kasim i believe this to be his name who was beyond friendly and wanting to help us in any way he could we ate our breakfast and quickly left to find a taxi since the hotel is so far from the street we didnt know how to get a taxi and i went back to the hotel while my partner stayed by the luggage they sent one of their employees to help us hail a taxi the customer service didnt stop there i was on the plane back home hooked up to wifi when i got an email from them a few hours later that told me they had found my ipad in the room i didnt realize it fell out of my bag i told them i would pay for them to ship it back i ended up speaking with the concierge abdul yaseem at the arabian courtyard hotel as it is their bigger sister hotel and they were very responsive and gave me good directions so that we could get the ipad shipped back i received it about a week later and in perfect condition abdul even followed up with an email to make sure i received it i have never had such amazing service and what a ethical job they did to process cash sent and safely shipped my ipad back it was more than i could have ever expected i dont think i can praise them enough i would 100 stay here again if i have a layover in dubai again i hope this review holds some weight because they really went so far beyond what i have received in customer service from any hotel previously in my travels thank you to everyone who provided a good stay and got my ipad back home to me many many thanks we stayed at the barjeel for one night and were delighted with the 2 courtyard rooms they were spacious well fitted and very comfortable we had no problem finding the place as it was next door to our cousins place of work lunch at the restaurant was lovely great outdoor seating with a lovely view over the old harbour not the dubai that we knew from tv at all we saw that later coming back from the dubai mall area in the evening was really easy with the metro good nights sleep decent breakfast not as good as the lunch and off to see more of dubai when we came back in the evening for our suitcases to return to abu dhabi the hotel manager walked us to a taxi and arranged our drive back very handsome service thank you so much staying at the barjeel and seeing the show at the burj khalifa showed us very different sides of dubai both were very worthwhile thank you for the hospitalitywhy stay in an anonymous block when you can stay in a lovely moorish style guest house right by the water a minutes walk to the water taxi station from there straight over to the gold souk lovely courtyard safe clean and service an example for all simply superb would absolutely stay here on any trip to dubaithe waiter here was very friendly and helpful his english was excellent the food was very good and we sat and watched the boats depart from the creek even had kunafe for dessert it is right by the house of sheikh khalifa bin saeed al maktoum which is how we happened to pick this place at random we were very happy to have found it by mistake we did not stay in the guest house just eat at the restaurantthe hotel is in a great location  approximately 150 meters to the nearest train station metro green line  station 24 and immediately outside the front door is dubai creek promenade a short walk away is the bur dubai abra dock where you can take a traditional dowh wooden boat across the river cost dh1 per person to explore the spice gold  perfume souks of deira there is also an enormous carrefour supermarket nearby  extremely handy for stocking up on essential supplies as well as bottled water and snacks the rooms are very nicely decorated but the lighting is very very dull so dont expect to see clearly good luck ladies with applying your makeup breakfast is adequate we dined once during the evening and while the taste of the food was lovely the meals we received were different to what was described on the menu if a meal is described as being accompanied with salad and chips thats what should be served  not a couple of shards of carrot on the plate thats a garnish not a salad the quantity of food was also lacking very small portions for the price one very frustrating aspect we found during our stay was that reception was hardly ever manned the hotel asks that you drop your key at reception when leaving for your days activities however each morning we had to search to find a member of staff to leave the key with and then when returning in the afternoonearly evening we usually had to search again for a member of staff in order to collect it and gain access to our room not a huge issue for us but some people may find this annoying we saw guests dropping and collecting keys themselves from the secure holding box this is a security issue in my opinion also reception is near the hotels back entrance and if its unattended its very easy for someone to wander in from the outdoor public space locals gather on the grass to enjoy social time  guests store their bags in reception when checking out early so that could be a security concern overall we enjoyed our stay  but we dont like the massive manufactured hotels  instead much preferring boutique properties the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpfulstayed here for one night on my way to australia the hotel is full of character and is in a nice location with a metro station al ghubaiba 100 meters away the room i had was clean basic and comfortable the restaurant was really good the staff were friendly the menu had a lot of choice and the food was great you sit outside over looking the marina all in all a bice hotelthis place is all about the location if you want the modern dubai 5 stars spa  this is not for you if you want to experience the authentic dubai from the past you will love this place in a pedestrian area it is very convenient to visit the old part  souks on both sides of the riverthey are getting ready for expo 2020 and the government is currently restoring many old buildings in the area midterm this will make this hotel even better but you may look at construction in the area over the next months we didnt hear any noise so it was no issue for uswe were very pleased with all of the staff including the waiters in the adjacent restaurant yes the prices are a little higher than in the local eateries but where can you sit in the evening on a roof all by yourself watching the boats go by and have some tea and dinnerany smaller issues like internet down or electricity gone were fixed immediately we spent a week here and loved itwe have eaten at this wonderful restaurant three times and each time it is so satisfying our waiter saykel was so helpful and kind i think we kept returning to the barjeel guest house because the breakfast was great value offering us americanenglishfrench food cooked the way we like it the location is lovely sitting outside in the sunshine eating good food and talking with a waiter with a great sense of humour and love for his employers restaurant right off the creek in the old part of town this guest house is a bargain with old fashioned rooms no windows but decorated stonework letting in sufficient light decent plumbing and excellent service the breakfast came with eggs cooked to order and for dinner we had their specialty camel tenderloin for me and kebobs for my husband tasted a bit like venison the location was perfect for sightseeing a short walk up to where the abras take off and close by a metro stationif you want a quiet place in the old part of dubai close to busstation and metro ghubaiba station on the green line near the metropolitan origin street where a freshmade juice cost 12aed and not 65 youve found your place the restaurant at the hotel has a toproofarea to dine or just relax or at levelground you can sit outside and watch the lighted restaurantboats or fisherboats go by 500m walk you can take the abra boat across to the souks for only 1aed the room we had was clean  with both fan and aircon and safe and with all we needed the staff was friendly and informative and i wouldnt hestitate twice to go back again advice the water in the showers was burning hot and to adjust to colder we had to run the water in the sink bit weird but no prob when you know about it  this property has the potential to be rated 5 stars as its location and guest rooms are very good but it goes down hill on a number of fronts and the biggest issue is the perceived lack of staff numbers and poor trainingwe arrived in dubai early in the morning and made it to barjeel relatively easily make sure you know exactly where the place is as our taxi driver had no idea as its a very small property at around 9am and unfortunately we were greeted but a completely empty reception and after looking around the property still couldnt find anyone around lucky for us a security guard of a neighboring site was kind enough to offer help and after about half hour we rang and rang until a butler picked up as he was asleep at 9am he notified the receptionist who finally arrived really needs training as we felt talking to her was like pulling teeth as she offered no information and we had to keep asking questions and we werent the only ones looking for a check in as another couple arrived soon after so they can corroborate our story the receptionist said we cant check in till eleven fair enough in a way but offered little in the way of guidance of what we should do it was 40c outside and when i asked if she had any brochures on things to do or see there wasnt much response and after again asking for at least a map of the area this is our first time to dubai found a small map which was pretty useless i find it extraordinary that a hotelguesthouse or any serious accommodation wouldnt provide their guests with some basic tourist guides and info in a foreign place anyway we were on our own so we ourselves and the new couple banded together and went out to kill 15 hours so we could check in and let me tell you after flying for half a day the last thing one wanted to do is go out in 40c heat in a foreign place with no helpful info from reception on where to go or what to do or even accommodate us temporarily in its restaurant for that timewhen we did check in after we suffered in the heat for 15 hours she could of told us there was a shopping centre 500m away there rooms were good and fairly comfy except there is no cold water we think the pipes get so hot that the cold water gets warmed so dont expect a soothing cold shower post a day out another small thing was i talked to the receptionist about our tv not working and she said she will get someone to have a look at it the next day but of course no one arrived only a small issue as we didnt come to watch tv but its the principle here the breakfast was well below a normal standard which is very surprising considering there is a big carrefour around the corner and one could easily supply everything one needs just from there for a breakfast overall not a very good experience and we think the guesthouse is being neglected by its parent heritage hotel and when we asked for an airport transfer it was very hard going and told in no uncertain terms that a driver can swing by barjeel from heritage at 630am after picking up guests from parent hotel and sounded like we were an inconvenience when asked about taxis all we got was yes they are around no we will arrange one for you at the time you desire to be perfectly honest the nice security guide was more of a help as he showed us how to use the metro and was going to take us to the taxi and he doesnt even work there im giving it an extra star as the location is excellent right on the water and witching a short stroll to souks and abras to take you across the river they desperately need to lift their gamewe have just returned from another wonderful trip to abu dhabi  dubai we always visit the heritage village in dubai  always stop to eat at this wonderful restaurant the food  service are always second to none  we would highly recommend itthis guest house is amazing the rooms are spacious and very authentic the staff are attentive to your needs overall the guest house is centrally located in the historic district  a great choice for accommodationsdont stay here if you want glitzy and flash hotel facilities normally associated with dubai hotels however should you be looking for somewhere more authentic and good value then this guest house is perfect small and quiet just 11 rooms i think yet in the heart of heritage village next door to the metro which makes travel very convenient especially to  from airportlocated on side of the creek it is lovely for sitting and watching local lifestaff are friendly and helpful but unobtrusiverooms are large and bathroom was huge wifi didnt work in the room but was fine if we sat out in the courtyardnote im reposting this under my profile as the earlier one was in response to an email i received from expedia which i did not realize would end up here ive revised and added some photoswe chose this guest house because we were in town for a conference but also intended to do some sightseeing and exploring there were things we particularly enjoyed about the guest housethe international staffbutlersveronica kenya abdul razek pakistan and nathan zimbabwe all were very kind and service oriented wait

earlier life at the edge of the bur dubai a historical neighborhood it feels like a bed and breakfast when the house is not full the butlers prepared breakfast for us to order when it was there was a buffetthe locationadjacent to the metro it is also close to the ferry and boats on the dubai creek as well as buses souk al kabeer the textile souk is a 510 minute walk and my husband reminds me that carrefour a well stocked grocery store is nearby photos are from the rooftop and interior courtyard dubai has more than its share of generic sterile international hotel chains barjeel was exactly the opposite  near many museums the textile souk and the ferry across dubai creek to the other old souks in an area that is rapidly but lowrise developing along the creek with a enjoyable promenade spacious room amenities ac ifwhen we return to dubai this will be our 1 optioncannot recommend the guest house highly enough set in the historical heritage centre of dubai spacious moorish style rooms superb ac peaceful courtyard to sit terrace with wonderful views of the creekthe staff were excellent happy to see you couldnt do enough for you it was a fantastic introduction to uae to my family who had never been there beforebreakfast was brilliant checkin and checkout was easythe only drawback was that as a uae resident i was ferrying my family around in my car and the guest house has no parking there is parking nearby but the machines would only allow 4 hours paid parking at a time as a result i ended up with a parking fine but to be honest i would risk it again for the truly wonderful time my family had staying herewe loved this little guesthouse by the creek had been recommended when we could not stay at the oriental guesthouse due to renovations love the location so close to the fabric souk the creek night life the arabian tea house and the bastakiya district the staff are friendly and professional and we felt very welcome huge rooms with large bathrooms and lounge area we will be back if you are looking for dubai 5 spa pool a beach this is not for you if you want to experience the authentic dubai from the past you will love this place in a pedestrian area it is very convenient to visit the old part  souks on both sides of the river it is situated 100 metres from dubai metro  bus station al ghubabaiba it forms part of the development along the creek heritage village this is still work in progress it is single storey low rise no issues with cranes or construction at all getting there best by public transport  water taxi taximetrobus  there is no parking for cars so you have to carry your bag from nearest pointroom was delightful  well appointed good size authentic clean with ac modern shower etc it was like staying in an arab house a nice experience if you want to explore old dubai and stroll along the waterfront and thru to the souk and the fort this would be an excellent choice i took breakfast on the terrace overlooking the creek and watched to people transit to work enjoyarchitecture is nice and authenticalso decoration and location but their restaurant is one of the worst i tried in my lifefood is horrible and overpriced zero for taste doesnt deserve the mark they get from trip advisor waiters look lazy and not clean if u want to drink tea and coffee its good to relax and enjoy the view but food please dont dare to taste i think that they should not cheat tourists by offering them something which has nothing to do with true arabic hospitality and by using the beauty of locationit is really shameful the way they serve the foodif u want to try arabic food go and try some of the restaurants in muraqabat or shopping mallswe stayed in feb 2016 we really wanted to stay in a place and a location that gave a feeling of the old dubai we were not disappointed its an excellent location really easy to get around from there because of the closeness of the metro the dubai water taxis abras are only a very short walk from the guest house and cross the dubai creek to the old city its all a world away from the dubai that most people would be familiar withbarjeel guest house had very friendly and obliging staff and a lot of characterthe downside was a shower that didnt drain effectively but that didnt really detract from the positiveswe spent 2 nights at the barjeel heritage guest house we were very glad that we chose it over a highrise chain hotel in the suburbs we enjoyed the traditional style room but the highlight for us was the waterfront location on dubai creek it was a lovely walk along the waterfront to the abra dock for the short voyage across the creek to the spice and gold souks the textile souks near the abra dock were also fun to walk through we ate cheaply outdoors at a snack kiosk near the guest house the metro station is just behind the guest house so its also convenient for trips to the malls and the burjthe barjeel guest house was a very pleasant surprise very good location next to the see and next to the historical neighborhood souksthe guest house is an authentic wind tower with very nice room in the pure arabic stylewelcoming and helpful staffi highly recommend this place as this is a great experience to change from the standardized hotelsit was the first find in dubai and turned out to be well worth for an experience the location is good and interesting along with being accessible the rooms at the place are spacious and comfortable the architecture and the whole design of the place are done in traditional form and gives you the feel of the true cultural spirit loved the stay at the placewe stayed here 2 days it was nice the people working in the hotel are really professional and friendly they help me a lot i had 5 luggages the taxi driver left me without any help and the woman alena from the hotel could see that and she directly came with a trolley to help merooms are antic as an arabian stylethe washroom is huge the shower is clean and work wellthe best point is no night club in the hotel so at night you can sleep close to bus and metro stationclose to the old souk marketreally good hotel and really flexible they let us stay longer in the room and kept our luggageand there is the shuttle bus to the airport thanks to alena and the teamthe barjeel heritage guesthouse is at a lovely location at the dubai creek when we checked in they where surprised that my husband and i both stayed at the hotel for 2 nights we got the smallest room at diner time we where on the terras and had to ask 3 times if someone could help us food was fine but the service not breakfast was terrible we had to wait for 30 minutes to get something to eat and it wasnt good at all after a day of sightseeing our room was not clean that was our fault because we took the key we got in touch with the manager and he offered another hotel nearby but for us it was to late next day we left very disappointing this hotel is so cute and is in the lovely heritage village it is opposite the metro station and next to dubai creek spacious room with air con and a large shower room nice gardens and terrace to sit in keys must be handed in to reception when leaving the hotel this means no chance of loosing them very nice hotel when i arrived at the arc by bar in the first metro  but did not know this hotel where to find  and listen to the people around  was found in the soon as look for it is said that it is directly above the station  the hotel is with breakfast  yes wifi at oclock chocks out two  was about 7000 yen  i think considering dubai hotels circumstances and cheap enough  service is also good  the front of the corresponding is also quite good  other room is clean widely  the courtyard of the hotel has become a characteristic making as shown in the photograph  here really can be recommended  rooms are small likely because soon in the reservation the staff were delightful and very helpful and friendlyyou need to have the phone number on you because the taxis can only get so close they will rush out and help with a trolley but be aware you dont get dropped right at the door and my taxi struggled to find it so make sure you print a mapthis place is right alongside the water and next to heritage village it is traditional style building which oozes charm the room was spacious and comfortable the amenities were really nice qualityit is a small place with a handful of rooms around a central courtyardthe rooftop area is really relaxing and you can watch the water and all the traditional dhowsthe location is really close to al gubaiba metroi wanted to stay again on my current trip but it was booked out i regret not reserving but wasnt 100 on my planswe had a four night stay at barjeel on our way to australia the hotel has a perfect location for discovering dubai central to old dubai and financial district and not too far the beach areathe building is old andhas suffered from rising damp in the past however there is no sign of dampness nowthe rooms surround the central courtyard and are beatifully decorated in arabian style the staff were very friendly and efficient especially ali and alena the people we had the most dealing withthe breakfast was excellent and had to be booked the previous evening the restaurant was also excellent see separate reveiwi would highly recommend this hotel on the beautiful creek for discovering dubaithe restaurant is awfulextremely disappointing experience drinks were fine but the starters were tasteless the main problem however was the main meal we ordered a seafood platter it was over cooked and missing a third of the fishes listed on the menu we told the manager that the lobster was way over cooked and we were missing fish and vegetables from the platter he did send out the missing fish and veg after a long waitagain cooked to an unsatisfactory standard the manager didnt seem to care about the quality of service and was not apologetic or professional in anywaywould not recommend this placejust arrange a company small meeting in this guest house it is a great place to have small group meeting and also recommended for family eventsi really like the place eash accessablemetro bus taxi water bus etc and with a great viewand i think it will be more good in the night timebtw the guest house staff also very very good and nicelocated right on the creek and in the heritage village this is a great hotel no facilities but very quiet and beautiful great service good breakfast large clean rooms private and with a great restaurant i could find no fault located right in front of the metro if you like to relax after a busy day in the city this is the best part of dubai really recommendedmy husband and i stayed here for 4 nights while visiting dubai on holiday and thoroughly enjoyed the guesthouse great location directly opposite a subway station in the old heritage part of the city near to museums and old courtyard houses the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful particularly alena and sayed ali at reception and it was a unique experience to stay in a heritage house excellent breakfast free wifi access to pool and gym at a nearby hotel though we didnt get around to checking these out clean room and very reasonable rates definitely recommend for those touring the cityi never regretted my decision to start my dubai trip with a stay at this guesthouse overlooking the creek it gives you a nice view when you had breakfast or dinner at the restaurant the hotel room is clean and airconditioned all the doors at this guesthouse are wooden with gold locks very authentic setting the amenities near the surrounding neighbourhood is good too you dont need to walk far to get to a convenience store which even have a mini spice souk and arrays of dates and chocolates i would definitely come back if i had the chance we had originally booked and paid to stay at ahmedia heritage guest house but despite our advance booking and payment it was full so they transferred us to another guest house in their chain barjeel heritage guest housethis proved to be an excellent place to stay with a wonderful location right beside dubai creek and 23 min from a metro and bus station the staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was excellent and served overlooking dubai creek we had two other meals at the excellent restaurantit is located next to the yet to be completed dubai heritage village and provides a welcome change from international chain hotels and modern places that look the same regardless of where they are nice design and touches to reflect the local culture and excellent local food tooalthough we had booked a family room with one double and two single beds we got a room with two large double beds which proved to be ok the room was nicely furnished with a fridge art teacoffee facilities air con and a large modern bathroom the free wifi was excellentthe guest house had a nice courtyard area but given the high temperatures max 46 deg c each day an air conditioned lounge would have been nicei have no hesitation recommending the guest house and its restauranti stayed only two nights at barjeel but it was a very pleasant stay the location is excellent and the architecture of the guesthouse gives you an idea of arabic culture before the skyscrapers took over the city the rooms are very nice and have all amenities one can ask for  the breakfast needs to be preordered the evening before which gives you a little less flexibility but its worthy as it is really good the staff was very welcoming and flexible and if you hang around a bit you will meet very interesting people who are staying long time at barjeel and are open for a chat i would stay there again for sure especially given the good price levelthe rooms were charming although given the structure be prepared for devices you bring to loose battery life fast the staff were terrific sweet and accommodating we loved being on the creek in the older part of dubaiits about 56 yrs old  so for this we were a bit surprised to find a room and bathroom that was quite filthy and the bathroom smelt of urine the walls were badly marked and obvious cobwebs everywhere the curtaining was i believe was original and never been washed the air conditioning was very noisy and original and the vents had never been cleaned breakfast was equivalent to a 2 star hotel where the room was i felt uneasy because of constant loitering at the room entrance by local youthsin summing one be better off booking into a 2 star hoteltaxi drivers dont know where to find the hotel because they cannot reach it by car this makes it a nice area to stroll along and explore the creek as we did the hotel has an excellent rooftop restaurant and the rooms are spacious i do not know how often they make up the rooms but its not every daystayed 3 nights in old dubai after a business trip and wanted to get a flavor of a traditional arabian guest house after staying in a chain hotel the barjeel heritage guest house is situated in a historic part of old dubai great part of its location is that it is literally steps away from a metro station al ghubaiba my room was spartan includes bathroom but very comfortable off a charming courtyard there is a restaurant onsite where i had breakfast included in my room charge  pleasant dining area but i was the only one there each morning i like to eat early and see the sights breakfast was strictly western style for guests though there is a sign board outside which advertises traditional arabian breakfasts restaurant overlooks the dubai creek lots of street activity outside  joggers families strolling at all hours of the day  great local color i would definitely recommend staying here if one wants a different experience from the boring chain hotels in modern dubai this location was extremely convenient as i booked local tours and made my way to nearby destinationswe chose barjeel as we wanted to experience true dubai and we couldnt have chosen better it was located in a perfect location for easy access from the train station and the rooms were cool and clean although you could eat at the restaurant which we did there were a number of places within walking distance where you could also purchase amazing meals do prepare for the heat though as it is overwhelming but the camel burgers are amazingthis is a unique property in dubai being a renovated 100 year old house located in the heritage village this area has a lot of charm located on the banks of dubai creek near to souks and restaurants instead of freeways and soulless skyscrapersit was easy to find from airport take the metro one change of line hen get off at al gubaiba station taking the east heritage village exit the guest house entrance is visible from outside the metro but there is a secret passageway to reception thats not well marked security is lax and anyone can walk in from that back entrance location is great there is a mall and supermarket across the road and if the metro is closed you can get an abra across the creek for 1 dirham with the localsreception were friendly and helpful room we not ready so we had lunch in the adjacent restaurant which served tasty food with plenty of local flavours on the menu including camel kebabs the rooms are spartan but are in traditional style and comfortable they are let down by cleaning with dirty toilet rim mouldy shower and dusty bed cover clearly noticeable the bar fridge also needed a clean out from a bad smellthere is complete darkness inside with old style windows and lock and key door which poses a fire hazard if someone locks you in from outside but if you want to sleep in this is not the place as staff were going about their business in the open courtyard clearly audible from the roomin summary this guest house does not have the standards or comforts of a chain hotel but if you are a forgiving traveller it makes up for that in charm and character  both of which is hard to find in dubaithis is the second time i have stayed in one of these heritage houses in bur dubai last time i was booked to stay at the orient guest house and was moved to the barjeel guest house this time they did the reverse despite the municipality taking one room out of action nobody bothered to notify me of this until i arrived and phone to find out where i should park some girl whining on the end of the phone with limp excuses and apologies simply doesnt wash they simply dont care about their customers enough and their casual attitude is not in keeping with the intention of the authorities that visitors to the city should be well treated the management of all the guest houses is through the arabian courtyard hotel so any queries need to go to them rather that to the butlers who dont seem to know their elbow from their backend perhaps the municipality should take their buildings back put in local managers and run it properly because the current ones are not and it is giving the whole concept a bad namewe spent two nights in the barjeel heritage guest house in dubai the location is really good for excursions the metro is 2 mins away the creek side with some restaurants and bars is just in front of the hotel and the water taxis or dubai ferry is also nearby we really enjoyed the traditional arabic room it was quiet airconditioned and clean the frontstaff could be a little more attentive and the breakfast which was good has also some room for improvement for us the location was really important metro to the airport 25 mins so we would chose the guest house againif you want to stay somewhere with character and with easy access to old dubai the barjeel guesthouse is really worth trying it has a lot going for it  a scenic location on dubai creek its own very reasonably priced  high quality restaurant a stones throw from the metro  a 5 minute walk to some of the old souks we thought they had 24 hr checkin but when we arrived at 6am we were told that we would have to pay aed 150 to checkin early however we didnt regret paying extra because wed had an overnight flight  it allowed us to have a rest before going out to explore if you have small bags it is very easy and cost effective to take the metro from the airport beware of taxi drivers approaching you in the airport a driver offered to take us to the guesthouse for aed 150 when i said that id heard the fare should be aed 25 he just walked away having said that when we got in the taxi at the rank just outside customs there was a flag fall of 25 and another 25 fare to get to the guesthouse we were very satisfied with the guesthouse and will certainly recommend it to friendsi did not stay here just ate at the restaurant really good if you like rare they can do it rare i had to send their first attempt back but they sure did get it right on the second the service was very friendly and the price was quite reasonable probably the best meal i had in a week in dubaiwe stayed in their suite which was a a very large room with a majilis it was nice to stay in hotel in dubai that isnt a concrete and glass tower you will have some issues with the plumbing as with older hotels and we had to search for a plug to plug in the kettle but with the room overlooking a beautiful green gardenthe hotel is right on the creek in the older part of dubai which is actively being renovated and there are 5 o r 6 interesting museums scattered around the areawe wandered around the area and went to bur dubai and found a very cheap but tasty indian meal in one of the plethera of indian restaurants in the area the hotel is right next to the metro so cheap access to the city is readily availablethere are also']"

tofrom airport and dubai mall alsovery helpful staff clean room value for moneycheck iin and check out process very easy and 24 hour availablei will stay again at this hotelduring my recent two week stay at the premier inn international hotel in dubai i would like to commend the hotel staff for their positive attitude and commitment to their respective assigned duties my room was cleaned on a daily basis by the housekeeping staff and they cared about the quality of their work the restaurant was clean and presentation was fantastic the breakfast buffet was plentiful on the serving line or one could opt for the continental breakfast consisting of fresh fruits breads and granola cereal the lunch and dinner buffets plentiful and nutritious along with fresh fruits pastries and juicesthe restaurant staff all performed their respective duties in a professional courteous manner i would like to single out jocelyn a waitress at the restaurant a sweet and charming person always with a pleasing smile i noticed the dedication and professionalism that jocelyn portrayed in the course of her duties always available to help and assist customers with a can do attitude in my view jocelyn is a vital asset to the operational staff at the premier inn international hotel dubai uaei would definitely stay at the premiere inn again in the futurewonderful to stay with your hotel just bed was not prepared well need bed preparation training to housekeeping describe the service you experienced good tell us how you liked the room good talk about the location  amenities good say what you liked best  least food my family had a recent long layover in dubai i chose premier inn mainly for the proximity to the airport and the good reviews i saw it was a very good choice we arrived about 5 am and had a scheduled checkin for 2 pm the staff was very helpful and allowed us to check in early at no extra charge this was great and allowed us to get a little rest before sightseeing from the shuttle drivers to front desk staff you could see they were committed to making sure guests had a great experience the room was very clean and beds were comfy we didnt have any meals there so i cant speak about that the room was stocked with a minifridge water and coffeetea making ingredients i would definitely stay at premier inn again the staff made my familys first visit to dubai a very pleasant onewe booked one night at premier inn to cover our 17 hour stop over in dubai getting to and from the hotel was so easy in the shuttle bus and the staff were lovely and welcoming our stay allowed us to relax and recharge and i would highly recommend premier inn to anyoneshuttle service is available through out day n night breakfast is complementary and goodhave a small swimming pool on top property is very clean and perfect room are spacious but beds are very hard value for moneythe hotel promised early checkin  priority was given to new checkin customers while prebooked where made to wait  bedsheets where never changed  room was rush cleaned  no water no towels  receptionist are not helpful and welcoming as they use to be  stayed here many times but the hotel is over booked and maybe thats why they dont seem to care anymore the bedsheets where never changed once during our 4day stay  only 1 towel and no water  they was a very foul smell in the corridor on the 3rd floor and it remained during our stay nobody bothered to check it  very nice and clean good ambiance shuttle service was remarkable akhila bea  ryan were superb the entire check in process was explained in detailed every amenity offered was explained in detail as well to arrive at a hotel at 1030 am it is extremely rare to get checked in before 2pm they were able to get me check in by 1100 and explained the process and gave me the option of freshening up while i waited left no question unansweredvery clean friendly staff great roof top pool with awesome views very good valuekhem the life guard really looked after usevening buffet was excellent great opportunity to try different foodour first stay was so good we booked another night on our return tripairport shuttle was an added bonus great pick up and drop off location just look for the purple mini buswe really appreciated the comfortable room air conditioning and availability of dinner and breakfast on the premises the free shuttle bus service makes a short stay so much easier a special thanks to the staff bea zankrit akhila and the breakfast staff such a welcome and great servicemy check in experience was very bad booked the room in april called my bank to allow the transaction which they did on getting there was informed that my card was never charged  was i furious they apparently tried to charge a day before  i guess i was midair in my 14 hour flight  no one bothered to inform me because my bank wont allow it unless i call them to authorize the transaction everyone knows how terrible their wifi is so calling my bank was out of question luckily i have another card from my home country  that was the one i used otherwise i wouldve been stranded with two kids because someone did not do their job well that checkin experience left a bitter taste in my mouth i just did not get around to appreciate the hotel 55 for all aspects with the exception of the baby cot being old dirty and rippedif it was the uk the cot would have been scrapped long ago dont let it put you off though because everything else is spot onthe building is dated but like i say its a good hotel for close to the airport stays and the food and staff are very very goodthe hotel is right across from dubai international airport and its a short drive away and its priced reasonably for a quick stay its very clean and the beds are comfy and the staff are friendly and helpful especially alice and amy they took care of us me and my partner the last time we stayed there over the weekendi wasnt expected to stay in dubai for a night but i was lucky to crash over on their bed it was one of the best beds i ever had speaking of the cleanliness it likes your home if i have another layover ill definitely book again i stayed there for one night it was really awesome stay neat and clean room check in  check out was really smooth breakfast options were amazing pure professional team mr riaz of maintenance is a amazing person to have in team booked a overnight stay for transit by mistake i choose the wrong date at a non refundable rate but bookingcom and the hotel allowed to cancel for freehotel offers free shuttle service 247 a nice pool on the rooftop staff was always friendly and helpful would totally recommendi booked premier inn for a 3 day stopover and enjoyed the stay the shuttle service made it easy arriving late night with a child i didnt have to look for taxi also getting back to the airport for my departure the shuttle service to deira is provided by someone different and it wasnt as pleasant as the premier shuttle though the hotel is opposite the airport there was no noise it is well soundproofed room was clean and comfortable and extra bed provided at no extra cost for the family room i found the breakfast to be expensive but up to 2 children eat free for a paying adulti have a transit flight so i spent one night at premier inn dubai and they give us free shuttle bus from airport and to some malls so i recommend this place for people who want to stay short time enjoy perfect for stopover shuttle bus service 2for 1 offers on food  drink friendly  helpful staff clean  comfy room fast  efficient checkin have stayed here before en route to australia  will stay againi stayed in this premier inn for one night as a stop over for a flight the staff were extremely friendly we were served by zanhrit who couldnt of been more helpful the room was very clean we ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner and it was beautiful one of the nicest steaks we have ever had again the staff couldnt of been more helpful my friend who lives in dubai joined us for dinner and was very impressed by the menu and said she would 100 go there to dine again there is also a pool hot tub and gym on the top flooroverall this hotel was great value for money and we couldnt thank zanhrit and the rest of the staff enough for making us feel so welcome we will be staying again on our way home for thailandthe hotel is good as a very convenient location for those who have continued flights through dubai airport very close to the airport the hotel offers free buses from and to the airport every hour the rooms are simple but the price is very suitablethis is like any other premier inn hotel however it is so close to the airport that it makes for a great value lay over spot very little aircraft noise too rooms are clean and the staff friendly and helpfulzankit and grace  monday night carvery was a hit and made a refreshing change to curry and riceworth considering if you have a night to spare to break up a longer journey pool and fitness center are good enough without being 5 star costa coffee next to reception which is always a plus for mei stayed at this jewel of a hotel for 7 nights and they provided more than a value for money service the hotel shuttle is a blessing and always timely the driver of the shuttle is a nice chap then by the front desk i met a very helpful lady by name gracewhose smiles fill the atmosphere ever willingly to render assistance at any time jovial smart and well trained on customer service etiqqutte grace was highly customer oriented then the housekeeping staff were very helpful especially prekeshbad reception alkahlia is a very rude mean and poor service delivery staffwho has no patience in attending to guest always looking disgruntled

grace at the reception for her professional and quick assistance breakfast is excellent and offer a wide selection you will probably be greeted by jocelyn she always smiles and always make sure you dont leave hungry haha she is also good to personalize her approach and remembers your preferences mine is the strawberry yogurt lol to end my review the most important point and not the least is the cleaness of the room always clean and comfortable thanks to soc from the cleaning team who ensured high level of standardsthe hotel is simply the best for service and accommodation to all airport terminals it is the choice for flight crews the bar and restaurant are equally great welcoming jocelyn adds to the service and freshness of both with a smile attentiveness and beauty premier inn excels in all ways value access and location people especially and especially jocelyn who always makes each guest feel like they will always want to come backquite atmosphere and staff were friendly but the blankets and bed sheets were not good and they smell the shuttle to nearby malls pass by many hotels before going to anywhere it is better to go by a taxicab and save your time and comfort very good hotel  was very clean rooms  near to the airport  very easy transfer by bus from airport to the hoteland from hotel to airportvery good stuff in reception and very friendlyrecommended very mucha great place to be in dubai media city a watering hole for all the media city people binson and arvind are the rockstar bartenders ready to serve with a smile every time you want a drink great for watching football and cricket games all through the yearnice and pleasant one night stay so nothing to complain the best value is free airport shuttle i can haihly recommend this hotek for those who are traveliing i will choose your hotel when i visit dubai againwas nice comfortable stay overnight but the staff didnt wake me up for my flight as i was going to miss my flight and i already requested for a wake up call my family was with me my wife and 5 kids so i woke up by my self at 7 and the flight was at 825amthe hotel is rated 3 stars it should be rated 5 stars always genuine services provided atmosphere is very delightful staff is always courteous i always enjoy my stay pricing is well rounded to provide the tourist the most for their dollars spent the premier inn is no doubt centrally located in the idea location to access the airport quickly the drivers who run the shuttle is always eager to provide assistance to the tourist i fully think the premier inn is the best hotel in the uae when it comes to attending to the tourist and providing services thank you premier innnice hotel to stay room was very nice staffs were good and excellent overall it was an awesome stay at hotel when i decided to extended my stay i thought it will be difficult to get the room but the staff helped me out and got the room easyso im writing this review just after ive been trying to get to sleep for the last 30 minutes i havent been able to sleep because the pillows are just awful theyre itchy theyre flat and just downright painful to sleep with just after 30 minutes of trying my neck is aching really badly and is in agony which isnt very beneficial for me due to the simple fact that ive got a 9 hour flight tomorrow at 9 in the morning so im going to be tired or even exhausted if youd like along with a agonisingly painful neck this is just great i have been to many different premier inns throughout my travels and this one is the worst one that ive ever stayed in by far usually the sleep experience is what premier inns are normally known for however this one embarrasses the hotels reputation by putting their guests who pay for a good nights sleep in pain overall i do not recommend this premier inn for anyone whos looking to stay here unless you want your neck to be put in painnice and friendly staff great location to airport and other things you have a shuttle service not to just the airport but to other popular locations around dubai rooms clean well lit great channel selection nice restaurant bar and coffee shop in hotel the location of the hotel is great near the airport and free shuttle bus directly to the terminals special thanks to khaldoon walaa mahmood alice nitin akila zikrit amy bia and narayan from front office and renglyn from the restaurant for making our stay an amazing one i liked everything but the room were the best feature the food wasnt bad either i enjoyed the hamburger it was classic though i felt like going to tour the city which i failed the staff was helpful especially one girl and a mani love the great rates and lovely rooms the staff was welcoming and i had no rouble being checked in and quickly receiving my cards to my room its tricky to enter the campus but absolutely no locatio is easier if you are coming or going from dxbhotel is very good handy clean and comfortablebreakfast is excellent

            "only had two days here to break the long trip home to sydney from madrid but long enough to see the main sites this hotel is very traditional in design and room layout rooms are spacious and very well air conditionedthank goodness great to be next to the waterfrontthe adjoining restaurant serves wonderful arabic meals at good prices we loved their fresh lemon juice with mintrefreshingonly negativetaxis can not find it we spent almost 40 minutes getting there and only 20 to get back tell the driver to drop you at al ghubaiba metro stationits a 2 minute walk from there towards the waterfrontps the metro here is fast cheap and easy to get around use it instead of taxis to get to the burj etcperfect location near creak boat metro bus stop and carrefour beautiful surrounding  good price the price of room changes very fast noisy bedmodest breakfast the location of air condition canalfinal word i chose this hotel because it is near al ghubaiba bus station  abu dhabi busstayed there for an extended weekend we loved the hotel and the real heritage experience  the location is great directly at the creek and near the old souq metro also nearby so get around quickly and easily the room was large and clean staff nice and helpful also the price is quite reasonable compared to the other large hotels although the oasis beach tower is our favorite in dubai we would as well pick this guest house again  recommendedmy husband and i stayed in dubai at the barjeel for 2 nights on a quick layover the hotel was perfect and i wouldnt hesitate to stay there again if i were to return to dubai location was great staff were helpful room was large and the breakfast included was delicious we felt the barjeel was fantastic value for what we gotwe stayed at the hotel with our 10 month old baby the hotel has a nice arabic charm which separates it from big internationally stadardized hotels the staff was friendly and the room offered a lot of space the restaurant offers tasty food and the location of the hotel besides the canal invites for a walk a metro station is nearby so if your luggage is not too heavy the best way to get to the hotel is via metrosituation is excellent for exploring dubai  200m to the metro and a taxi rank and not much more to the abra station to cross the creek to the gold and spice souks however be aware that taxi drivers may not know of this hotel and that closest access by car is 200m walk which might matter if carrying luggage in the extreme heat my room was fine and everything essential worked but a little rough slats on bed sprung and decor crude staff very nice but no one serviced the room in my three night staywhen we first arrived our taxi driver didnt know how to get to the hotel there is no street infront and you must walk with your suitcases to find the hotel this is the only negative thing and if you know this it is much easier the hotel is right by the metro station and so close to the abra dock we were easily able to explore even staying there for 24 hours the reason i give this hotel 5 stars is because of their amazing customer service we were accommodated with arriving early at 6am we had to pay a fee of 37 us but it was the best money we spent as we had been traveling for almost a month and we were ready to rest they provided us our room helped carry our bags and also accommodated us with a very early morning breakfast on the next day when we departed they allowed us to have our continental breakfast at 630am  we were greeted by kasim i believe this to be his name who was beyond friendly and wanting to help us in any way he could we ate our breakfast and quickly left to find a taxi since the hotel is so far from the street we didnt know how to get a taxi and i went back to the hotel while my partner stayed by the luggage they sent one of their employees to help us hail a taxi the customer service didnt stop there i was on the plane back home hooked up to wifi when i got an email from them a few hours later that told me they had found my ipad in the room i didnt realize it fell out of my bag i told them i would pay for them to ship it back i ended up speaking with the concierge abdul yaseem at the arabian courtyard hotel as it is their bigger sister hotel and they were very responsive and gave me good directions so that we could get the ipad shipped back i received it about a week later and in perfect condition abdul even followed up with an email to make sure i received it i have never had such amazing service and what a ethical job they did to process cash sent and safely shipped my ipad back it was more than i could have ever expected i dont think i can praise them enough i would 100 stay here again if i have a layover in dubai again i hope this review holds some weight because they really went so far beyond what i have received in customer service from any hotel previously in my travels thank you to everyone who provided a good stay and got my ipad back home to me many many thanks we stayed at the barjeel for one night and were delighted with the 2 courtyard rooms they were spacious well fitted and very comfortable we had no problem finding the place as it was next door to our cousins place of work lunch at the restaurant was lovely great outdoor seating with a lovely view over the old harbour not the dubai that we knew from tv at all we saw that later coming back from the dubai mall area in the evening was really easy with the metro good nights sleep decent breakfast not as good as the lunch and off to see more of dubai when we came back in the evening for our suitcases to return to abu dhabi the hotel manager walked us to a taxi and arranged our drive back very handsome service thank you so much staying at the barjeel and seeing the show at the burj khalifa showed us very different sides of dubai both were very worthwhile thank you for the hospitalitywhy stay in an anonymous block when you can stay in a lovely moorish style guest house right by the water a minutes walk to the water taxi station from there straight over to the gold souk lovely courtyard safe clean and service an example for all simply superb would absolutely stay here on any trip to dubaithe waiter here was very friendly and helpful his english was excellent the food was very good and we sat and watched the boats depart from the creek even had kunafe for dessert it is right by the house of sheikh khalifa bin saeed al maktoum which is how we happened to pick this place at random we were very happy to have found it by mistake we did not stay in the guest house just eat at the restaurantthe hotel is in a great location  approximately 150 meters to the nearest train station metro green line  station 24 and immediately outside the front door is dubai creek promenade a short walk away is the bur dubai abra dock where you can take a traditional dowh wooden boat across the river cost dh1 per person to explore the spice gold  perfume souks of deira there is also an enormous carrefour supermarket nearby  extremely handy for stocking up on essential supplies as well as bottled water and snacks the rooms are very nicely decorated but the lighting is very very dull so dont expect to see clearly good luck ladies with applying your makeup breakfast is adequate we dined once during the evening and while the taste of the food was lovely the meals we received were different to what was described on the menu if a meal is described as being accompanied with salad and chips thats what should be served  not a couple of shards of carrot on the plate thats a garnish not a salad the quantity of food was also lacking very small portions for the price one very frustrating aspect we found during our stay was that reception was hardly ever manned the hotel asks that you drop your key at reception when leaving for your days activities however each morning we had to search to find a member of staff to leave the key with and then when returning in the afternoonearly evening we usually had to search again for a member of staff in order to collect it and gain access to our room not a huge issue for us but some people may find this annoying we saw guests dropping and collecting keys themselves from the secure holding box this is a security issue in my opinion also reception is near the hotels back entrance and if its unattended its very easy for someone to wander in from the outdoor public space locals gather on the grass to enjoy social time  guests store their bags in reception when checking out early so that could be a security concern overall we enjoyed our stay  but we dont like the massive manufactured hotels  instead much preferring boutique properties the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpfulstayed here for one night on my way to australia the hotel is full of character and is in a nice location with a metro station al ghubaiba 100 meters away the room i had was clean basic and comfortable the restaurant was really good the staff were friendly the menu had a lot of choice and the food was great you sit outside over looking the marina all in all a bice hotelthis place is all about the location if you want the modern dubai 5 stars spa  this is not for you if you want to experience the authentic dubai from the past you will love this place in a pedestrian area it is very convenient to visit the old part  souks on both sides of the riverthey are getting ready for expo 2020 and the government is currently restoring many old buildings in the area midterm this will make this hotel even better but you may look at construction in the area over the next months we didnt hear any noise so it was no issue for uswe were very pleased with all of the staff including the waiters in the adjacent restaurant yes the prices are a little higher than in the local eateries but where can you sit in the evening on a roof all by yourself watching the boats go by and have some tea and dinnerany smaller issues like internet down or electricity gone were fixed immediately we spent a week here and loved itwe have eaten at this wonderful restaurant three times and each time it is so satisfying our waiter saykel was so helpful and kind i think we kept returning to the barjeel guest house because the breakfast was great value offering us americanenglishfrench food cooked the way we like it the location is lovely sitting outside in the sunshine eating good food and talking with a waiter with a great sense of humour and love for his employers restaurant right off the creek in the old part of town this guest house is a bargain with old fashioned rooms no windows but decorated stonework letting in sufficient light decent plumbing and excellent service the breakfast came with eggs cooked to order and for dinner we had their specialty camel tenderloin for me and kebobs for my husband tasted a bit like venison the location was perfect for sightseeing a short walk up to where the abras take off and close by a metro stationif you want a quiet place in the old part of dubai close to busstation and metro ghubaiba station on the green line near the metropolitan origin street where a freshmade juice cost 12aed and not 65 youve found your place the restaurant at the hotel has a toproofarea to dine or just relax or at levelground you can sit outside and watch the lighted restaurantboats or fisherboats go by 500m walk you can take the abra boat across to the souks for only 1aed the room we had was clean  with both fan and aircon and safe and with all we needed the staff was friendly and informative and i wouldnt hestitate twice to go back again advice the water in the showers was burning hot and to adjust to colder we had to run the water in the sink bit weird but no prob when you know about it  this property has the potential to be rated 5 stars as its location and guest rooms are very good but it goes down hill on a number of fronts and the biggest issue is the perceived lack of staff numbers and poor trainingwe arrived in dubai early in the morning and made it to barjeel relatively easily make sure you know exactly where the place is as our taxi driver had no idea as its a very small property at around 9am and unfortunately we were greeted but a completely empty reception and after looking around the property still couldnt find anyone around lucky for us a security guard of a neighboring site was kind enough to offer help and after about half hour we rang and rang until a butler picked up as he was asleep at 9am he notified the receptionist who finally arrived really needs training as we felt talking to her was like pulling teeth as she offered no information and we had to keep asking questions and we werent the only ones looking for a check in as another couple arrived soon after so they can corroborate our story the receptionist said we cant check in till eleven fair enough in a way but offered little in the way of guidance of what we should do it was 40c outside and when i asked if she had any brochures on things to do or see there wasnt much response and after again asking for at least a map of the area this is our first time to dubai found a small map which was pretty useless i find it extraordinary that a hotelguesthouse or any serious accommodation wouldnt provide their guests with some basic tourist guides and info in a foreign place anyway we were on our own so we ourselves and the new couple banded together and went out to kill 15 hours so we could check in and let me tell you after flying for half a day the last thing one wanted to do is go out in 40c heat in a foreign place with no helpful info from reception on where to go or what to do or even accommodate us temporarily in its restaurant for that timewhen we did check in after we suffered in the heat for 15 hours she could of told us there was a shopping centre 500m away there rooms were good and fairly comfy except there is no cold water we think the pipes get so hot that the cold water gets warmed so dont expect a soothing cold shower post a day out another small thing was i talked to the receptionist about our tv not working and she said she will get someone to have a look at it the next day but of course no one arrived only a small issue as we didnt come to watch tv but its the principle here the breakfast was well below a normal standard which is very surprising considering there is a big carrefour around the corner and one could easily supply everything one needs just from there for a breakfast overall not a very good experience and we think the guesthouse is being neglected by its parent heritage hotel and when we asked for an airport transfer it was very hard going and told in no uncertain terms that a driver can swing by barjeel from heritage at 630am after picking up guests from parent hotel and sounded like we were an inconvenience when asked about taxis all we got was yes they are around no we will arrange one for you at the time you desire to be perfectly honest the nice security guide was more of a help as he showed us how to use the metro and was going to take us to the taxi and he doesnt even work there im giving it an extra star as the location is excellent right on the water and witching a short stroll to souks and abras to take you across the river they desperately need to lift their gamewe have just returned from another wonderful trip to abu dhabi  dubai we always visit the heritage village in dubai  always stop to eat at this wonderful restaurant the food  service are always second to none  we would highly recommend itthis guest house is amazing the rooms are spacious and very authentic the staff are attentive to your needs overall the guest house is centrally located in the historic district  a great choice for accommodationsdont stay here if you want glitzy and flash hotel facilities normally associated with dubai hotels however should you be looking for somewhere more authentic and good value then this guest house is perfect small and quiet just 11 rooms i think yet in the heart of heritage village next door to the metro which makes travel very convenient especially to  from airportlocated on side of the creek it is lovely for sitting and watching local lifestaff are friendly and helpful but unobtrusiverooms are large and bathroom was huge wifi didnt work in the room but was fine if we sat out in the courtyardnote im reposting this under my profile as the earlier one was in response to an email i received from expedia which i did not realize would end up here ive revised and added some photoswe chose this guest house because we were in town for a conference but also intended to do some sightseeing and exploring there were things we particularly enjoyed about the guest housethe international staffbutlersveronica kenya abdul razek pakistan and nathan zimbabwe all were very kind and service oriented wait staffahmed egypt samir pakistan and mary cameroonthe accommodationsthe guest house is an 11 room emirati home that has been restored the buildingexterior and interior are charming and a peek at an earlier life at the edge of the bur dubai a historical neighborhood it feels like a bed and breakfast when the house is not full the butlers prepared breakfast for us to order when it was there was a buffetthe locationadjacent to the metro it is also close to the ferry and boats on the dubai creek as well as buses souk al kabeer the textile souk is a 510 minute walk and my husband reminds me that carrefour a well stocked grocery store is nearby photos are from the rooftop and interior courtyard dubai has more than its share of generic sterile international hotel chains barjeel was exactly the opposite  near many museums the textile souk and the ferry across dubai creek to the other old souks in an area that is rapidly but lowrise developing along the creek with a enjoyable promenade spacious room amenities ac ifwhen we return to dubai this will be our 1 optioncannot recommend the guest house highly enough set in the historical heritage centre of dubai spacious moorish style rooms superb ac peaceful courtyard to sit terrace with wonderful views of the creekthe staff were excellent happy to see you couldnt do enough for you it was a fantastic introduction to uae to my family who had never been there beforebreakfast was brilliant checkin and checkout was easythe only drawback was that as a uae resident i was ferrying my family around in my car and the guest house has no parking there is parking nearby but the machines would only allow 4 hours paid parking at a time as a result i ended up with a parking fine but to be honest i would risk it again for the truly wonderful time my family had staying herewe loved this little guesthouse by the creek had been recommended when we could not stay at the oriental guesthouse due to renovations love the location so close to the fabric souk the creek night life the arabian tea house and the bastakiya district the staff are friendly and professional and we felt very welcome huge rooms with large bathrooms and lounge area we will be back if you are looking for dubai 5 spa pool a beach this is not for you if you want to experience the authentic dubai from the past you will love this place in a pedestrian area it is very convenient to visit the old part  souks on both sides of the river it is situated 100 metres from dubai metro  bus station al ghubabaiba it forms part of the development along the creek heritage village this is still work in progress it is single storey low rise no issues with cranes or construction at all getting there best by public transport  water taxi taximetrobus  there is no parking for cars so you have to carry your bag from nearest pointroom was delightful  well appointed good size authentic clean with ac modern shower etc it was like staying in an arab house a nice experience if you want to explore old dubai and stroll along the waterfront and thru to the souk and the fort this would be an excellent choice i took breakfast on the terrace overlooking the creek and watched to people transit to work enjoyarchitecture is nice and authenticalso decoration and location but their restaurant is one of the worst i tried in my lifefood is horrible and overpriced zero for taste doesnt deserve the mark they get from trip advisor waiters look lazy and not clean if u want to drink tea and coffee its good to relax and enjoy the view but food please dont dare to taste i think that they should not cheat tourists by offering them something which has nothing to do with true arabic hospitality and by using the beauty of locationit is really shameful the way they serve the foodif u want to try arabic food go and try some of the restaurants in muraqabat or shopping mallswe stayed in feb 2016 we really wanted to stay in a place and a location that gave a feeling of the old dubai we were not disappointed its an excellent location really easy to get around from there because of the closeness of the metro the dubai water taxis abras are only a very short walk from the guest house and cross the dubai creek to the old city its all a world away from the dubai that most people would be familiar withbarjeel guest house had very friendly and obliging staff and a lot of characterthe downside was a shower that didnt drain effectively but that didnt really detract from the positiveswe spent 2 nights at the barjeel heritage guest house we were very glad that we chose it over a highrise chain hotel in the suburbs we enjoyed the traditional style room but the highlight for us was the waterfront location on dubai creek it was a lovely walk along the waterfront to the abra dock for the short voyage across the creek to the spice and gold souks the textile souks near the abra dock were also fun to walk through we ate cheaply outdoors at a snack kiosk near the guest house the metro station is just behind the guest house so its also convenient for trips to the malls and the burjthe barjeel guest house was a very pleasant surprise very good location next to the see and next to the historical neighborhood souksthe guest house is an authentic wind tower with very nice room in the pure arabic stylewelcoming and helpful staffi highly recommend this place as this is a great experience to change from the standardized hotelsit was the first find in dubai and turned out to be well worth for an experience the location is good and interesting along with being accessible the rooms at the place are spacious and comfortable the architecture and the whole design of the place are done in traditional form and gives you the feel of the true cultural spirit loved the stay at the placewe stayed here 2 days it was nice the people working in the hotel are really professional and friendly they help me a lot i had 5 luggages the taxi driver left me without any help and the woman alena from the hotel could see that and she directly came with a trolley to help merooms are antic as an arabian stylethe washroom is huge the shower is clean and work wellthe best point is no night club in the hotel so at night you can sleep close to bus and metro stationclose to the old souk marketreally good hotel and really flexible they let us stay longer in the room and kept our luggageand there is the shuttle bus to the airport thanks to alena and the teamthe barjeel heritage guesthouse is at a lovely location at the dubai creek when we checked in they where surprised that my husband and i both stayed at the hotel for 2 nights we got the smallest room at diner time we where on the terras and had to ask 3 times if someone could help us food was fine but the service not breakfast was terrible we had to wait for 30 minutes to get something to eat and it wasnt good at all after a day of sightseeing our room was not clean that was our fault because we took the key we got in touch with the manager and he offered another hotel nearby but for us it was to late next day we left very disappointing this hotel is so cute and is in the lovely heritage village it is opposite the metro station and next to dubai creek spacious room with air con and a large shower room nice gardens and terrace to sit in keys must be handed in to reception when leaving the hotel this means no chance of loosing them very nice hotel when i arrived at the arc by bar in the first metro  but did not know this hotel where to find  and listen to the people around  was found in the soon as look for it is said that it is directly above the station  the hotel is with breakfast  yes wifi at oclock chocks out two  was about 7000 yen  i think considering dubai hotels circumstances and cheap enough  service is also good  the front of the corresponding is also quite good  other room is clean widely  the courtyard of the hotel has become a characteristic making as shown in the photograph  here really can be recommended  rooms are small likely because soon in the reservation the staff were delightful and very helpful and friendlyyou need to have the phone number on you because the taxis can only get so close they will rush out and help with a trolley but be aware you dont get dropped right at the door and my taxi struggled to find it so make sure you print a mapthis place is right alongside the water and next to heritage village it is traditional style building which oozes charm the room was spacious and comfortable the amenities were really nice qualityit is a small place with a handful of rooms around a central courtyardthe rooftop area is really relaxing and you can watch the water and all the traditional dhowsthe location is really close to al gubaiba metroi wanted to stay again on my current trip but it was booked out i regret not reserving but wasnt 100 on my planswe had a four night stay at barjeel on our way to australia the hotel has a perfect location for discovering dubai central to old dubai and financial district and not too far the beach areathe building is old andhas suffered from rising damp in the past however there is no sign of dampness nowthe rooms surround the central courtyard and are beatifully decorated in arabian style the staff were very friendly and efficient especially ali and alena the people we had the most dealing withthe breakfast was excellent and had to be booked the previous evening the restaurant was also excellent see separate reveiwi would highly recommend this hotel on the beautiful creek for discovering dubaithe restaurant is awfulextremely disappointing experience drinks were fine but the starters were tasteless the main problem however was the main meal we ordered a seafood platter it was over cooked and missing a third of the fishes listed on the menu we told the manager that the lobster was way over cooked and we were missing fish and vegetables from the platter he did send out the missing fish and veg after a long waitagain cooked to an unsatisfactory standard the manager didnt seem to care about the quality of service and was not apologetic or professional in anywaywould not recommend this placejust arrange a company small meeting in this guest house it is a great place to have small group meeting and also recommended for family eventsi really like the place eash accessablemetro bus taxi water bus etc and with a great viewand i think it will be more good in the night timebtw the guest house staff also very very good and nicelocated right on the creek and in the heritage village this is a great hotel no facilities but very quiet and beautiful great service good breakfast large clean rooms private and with a great restaurant i could find no fault located right in front of the metro if you like to relax after a busy day in the city this is the best part of dubai really recommendedmy husband and i stayed here for 4 nights while visiting dubai on holiday and thoroughly enjoyed the guesthouse great location directly opposite a subway station in the old heritage part of the city near to museums and old courtyard houses the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful particularly alena and sayed ali at reception and it was a unique experience to stay in a heritage house excellent breakfast free wifi access to pool and gym at a nearby hotel though we didnt get around to checking these out clean room and very reasonable rates definitely recommend for those touring the cityi never regretted my decision to start my dubai trip with a stay at this guesthouse overlooking the creek it gives you a nice view when you had breakfast or dinner at the restaurant the hotel room is clean and airconditioned all the doors at this guesthouse are wooden with gold locks very authentic setting the amenities near the surrounding neighbourhood is good too you dont need to walk far to get to a convenience store which even have a mini spice souk and arrays of dates and chocolates i would definitely come back if i had the chance we had originally booked and paid to stay at ahmedia heritage guest house but despite our advance booking and payment it was full so they transferred us to another guest house in their chain barjeel heritage guest housethis proved to be an excellent place to stay with a wonderful location right beside dubai creek and 23 min from a metro and bus station the staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was excellent and served overlooking dubai creek we had two other meals at the excellent restaurantit is located next to the yet to be completed dubai heritage village and provides a welcome change from international chain hotels and modern places that look the same regardless of where they are nice design and touches to reflect the local culture and excellent local food tooalthough we had booked a family room with one double and two single beds we got a room with two large double beds which proved to be ok the room was nicely furnished with a fridge art teacoffee facilities air con and a large modern bathroom the free wifi was excellentthe guest house had a nice courtyard area but given the high temperatures max 46 deg c each day an air conditioned lounge would have been nicei have no hesitation recommending the guest house and its restauranti stayed only two nights at barjeel but it was a very pleasant stay the location is excellent and the architecture of the guesthouse gives you an idea of arabic culture before the skyscrapers took over the city the rooms are very nice and have all amenities one can ask for  the breakfast needs to be preordered the evening before which gives you a little less flexibility but its worthy as it is really good the staff was very welcoming and flexible and if you hang around a bit you will meet very interesting people who are staying long time at barjeel and are open for a chat i would stay there again for sure especially given the good price levelthe rooms were charming although given the structure be prepared for devices you bring to loose battery life fast the staff were terrific sweet and accommodating we loved being on the creek in the older part of dubaiits about 56 yrs old  so for this we were a bit surprised to find a room and bathroom that was quite filthy and the bathroom smelt of urine the walls were badly marked and obvious cobwebs everywhere the curtaining was i believe was original and never been washed the air conditioning was very noisy and original and the vents had never been cleaned breakfast was equivalent to a 2 star hotel where the room was i felt uneasy because of constant loitering at the room entrance by local youthsin summing one be better off booking into a 2 star hoteltaxi drivers dont know where to find the hotel because they cannot reach it by car this makes it a nice area to stroll along and explore the creek as we did the hotel has an excellent rooftop restaurant and the rooms are spacious i do not know how often they make up the rooms but its not every daystayed 3 nights in old dubai after a business trip and wanted to get a flavor of a traditional arabian guest house after staying in a chain hotel the barjeel heritage guest house is situated in a historic part of old dubai great part of its location is that it is literally steps away from a metro station al ghubaiba my room was spartan includes bathroom but very comfortable off a charming courtyard there is a restaurant onsite where i had breakfast included in my room charge  pleasant dining area but i was the only one there each morning i like to eat early and see the sights breakfast was strictly western style for guests though there is a sign board outside which advertises traditional arabian breakfasts restaurant overlooks the dubai creek lots of street activity outside  joggers families strolling at all hours of the day  great local color i would definitely recommend staying here if one wants a different experience from the boring chain hotels in modern dubai this location was extremely convenient as i booked local tours and made my way to nearby destinationswe chose barjeel as we wanted to experience true dubai and we couldnt have chosen better it was located in a perfect location for easy access from the train station and the rooms were cool and clean although you could eat at the restaurant which we did there were a number of places within walking distance where you could also purchase amazing meals do prepare for the heat though as it is overwhelming but the camel burgers are amazingthis is a unique property in dubai being a renovated 100 year old house located in the heritage village this area has a lot of charm located on the banks of dubai creek near to souks and restaurants instead of freeways and soulless skyscrapersit was easy to find from airport take the metro one change of line hen get off at al gubaiba station taking the east heritage village exit the guest house entrance is visible from outside the metro but there is a secret passageway to reception thats not well marked security is lax and anyone can walk in from that back entrance location is great there is a mall and supermarket across the road and if the metro is closed you can get an abra across the creek for 1 dirham with the localsreception were friendly and helpful room we not ready so we had lunch in the adjacent restaurant which served tasty food with plenty of local flavours on the menu including camel kebabs the rooms are spartan but are in traditional style and comfortable they are let down by cleaning with dirty toilet rim mouldy shower and dusty bed cover clearly noticeable the bar fridge also needed a clean out from a bad smellthere is complete darkness inside with old style windows and lock and key door which poses a fire hazard if someone locks you in from outside but if you want to sleep in this is not the place as staff were going about their business in the open courtyard clearly audible from the roomin summary this guest house does not have the standards or comforts of a chain hotel but if you are a forgiving traveller it makes up for that in charm and character  both of which is hard to find in dubaithis is the second time i have stayed in one of these heritage houses in bur dubai last time i was booked to stay at the orient guest house and was moved to the barjeel guest house this time they did the reverse despite the municipality taking one room out of action nobody bothered to notify me of this until i arrived and phone to find out where i should park some girl whining on the end of the phone with limp excuses and apologies simply doesnt wash they simply dont care about their customers enough and their casual attitude is not in keeping with the intention of the authorities that visitors to the city should be well treated the management of all the guest houses is through the arabian courtyard hotel so any queries need to go to them rather that to the butlers who dont seem to know their elbow from their backend perhaps the municipality should take their buildings back put in local managers and run it properly because the current ones are not and it is giving the whole concept a bad namewe spent two nights in the barjeel heritage guest house in dubai the location is really good for excursions the metro is 2 mins away the creek side with some restaurants and bars is just in front of the hotel and the water taxis or dubai ferry is also nearby we really enjoyed the traditional arabic room it was quiet airconditioned and clean the frontstaff could be a little more attentive and the breakfast which was good has also some room for improvement for us the location was really important metro to the airport 25 mins so we would chose the guest house againif you want to stay somewhere with character and with easy access to old dubai the barjeel guesthouse is really worth trying it has a lot going for it  a scenic location on dubai creek its own very reasonably priced  high quality restaurant a stones throw from the metro  a 5 minute walk to some of the old souks we thought they had 24 hr checkin but when we arrived at 6am we were told that we would have to pay aed 150 to checkin early however we didnt regret paying extra because wed had an overnight flight  it allowed us to have a rest before going out to explore if you have small bags it is very easy and cost effective to take the metro from the airport beware of taxi drivers approaching you in the airport a driver offered to take us to the guesthouse for aed 150 when i said that id heard the fare should be aed 25 he just walked away having said that when we got in the taxi at the rank just outside customs there was a flag fall of 25 and another 25 fare to get to the guesthouse we were very satisfied with the guesthouse and will certainly recommend it to friendsi did not stay here just ate at the restaurant really good if you like rare they can do it rare i had to send their first attempt back but they sure did get it right on the second the service was very friendly and the price was quite reasonable probably the best meal i had in a week in dubaiwe stayed in their suite which was a a very large room with a majilis it was nice to stay in hotel in dubai that isnt a concrete and glass tower you will have some issues with the plumbing as with older hotels and we had to search for a plug to plug in the kettle but with the room overlooking a beautiful green gardenthe hotel is right on the creek in the older part of dubai which is actively being renovated and there are 5 o r 6 interesting museums scattered around the areawe wandered around the area and went to bur dubai and found a very cheap but tasty indian meal in one of the plethera of indian restaurants in the area the hotel is right next to the metro so cheap access to the city is readily availablethere are also

with very tasty food and reasonably priced beers it also had a very good atmosphere in there with many people playing pool and darts breakfast  this was ok with a reasonable but limited selection from the buffet for westerners the room itself was comfortable and appointed as you would expect  the bed was very comfortable and i slept very well there is also free underground car parking which was

my card next weird is to have a security deposit for all the consumables in the refrigerator for me preauth of 300 aed breakfatnot many option for indians specially vegetarians hotele has a bar  good for a budget hotel in dubai and 300  400 meter walk to metro sharaf dgoverall i didnt like it if you can afford this is not the option there is a goo done nearnovotelthis hotel certainly at the rate i paid represents fantastic value for money for a convenience one night stay the room was mainly clean and well presented the staff were all universally friendly pleasant and efficient in this area i cant imagine a better choice in terms of value for money the hotel is within walking distance of the metro and there is enough shade for this to be done even in early summer months taxis are easy to find outside there is also free underground parking but the entrance is not easy to spot as it is not well signed at the roadthe breakfast was standard for the uae in this type of hotel but certainly not bad service was friendly and the food freshmy only complaint is that i requested a nonsmoking room and although there was a small plastic sign on the table in the room to identify the room as such the room smelled very much of stale cigarette smoke so much so that my shirt left to hang over night smelled of smoke when i put it on in the morning not sure whether this was smells through the ac or older usage of the room but this would prevent me as a neversmoker staying longeri cant tell that this hotel is good because i had a bad experience since i reachedwhen i booked my room i could chose double bed or two single beds so if they allow you to chose it is because they have both options and they will book for you the one you chose we reached the hotel and the guy in the reception said us that they didntt have avaliable a room with double bed i said him that i didnt understand it because i booked specifically this bed and it was avaliablethe answer was the hotel is full today but i will compensate you with a upgraded bedroom we will join the beds and it will be like a big bedi said him that i was really disapointed because they shoud book the correct bed for us or dont give us that option if it was not avaliable for me one bedroom 5 square meters bigger is not a compensation in this casehe said us that the next day we would change the room to the one we booked lower level but with the big bed i explained him that it would be a waste of time and really unconfortable for us because we would have to pack again everything and move he said that we would have to proceed like this he didnt try to fix the situation in a better way simply with 5 square meters the first night and changing the room making us to move everything again then i wanted to keep a claim and the guy didnt allow me incrediblethen we went to the room we were waiting while one guy was joining the beds my husband expected something different in the way to join the beds to make them same as a double bed but they simply kept the beds beside each other even one was little higher than the otherone my husband called to the receptcion and he asked for the manager dutty time they informed us we cutted the call and after 1 minute they called back it was more than 130am and on theory someone cancelled a room just that moment and exactly the room that we booked same level same bed come on we changed the bedroom so we went to sleep after 200am on the other hand the room we got was neat and confortable only the smell was little bad like moisture about the breakfast we tasted a cake and small muffins which were really hard not fresh there were some kind of bread of lot of days before same with the cheese slicesthe croisants and napolitanas were fresh fruits they offer watermelon and melon and fruit saladtwo kind of cheese and turkey two kind of cerealscold mezza and some hot things like sausages boild eggs french toasts you can eat toasts but only with jam or honey i didnt see butter nor nutella or chocolate the location is good but arround the hotel you have to pay for the parking not too much but you have to save coins for it summarize they have to improve the organisation the way in which they solve the problems the smell in the rooms and take care about the things i mentioned in the breackfast too much thingsi want to say thank you very much to the hospitable staff of golden tulip we like the receptioniststhe restaurant hoststhe managers we turned for helpeverybody we liked breakfaststhey are tasty indeed we want to thank the cleaner of our room 219 who did it every morning i think i will be back to golden tulip again and will recommend it to my friends thank you very much againthe checkin wasnt quick a tall guy probably syrian nationality on the reception just forgot about guests who were sitting and waiting for his response when i just told him about ourselves he said sorry and didnt notice us as he was talking on the mobile phone laughing and nicely discussing something personal call he was very rude and didnt payed attention how to talk when we got to the room we recieved complimentary fruits due to a long checkin later on recieved a call for an additional payment as was mentioned it was for a security deposit it was very weird for a hotel and it wasnt mentioned on a booking when i was about to pay i had to go down as their machine was broken same guy said that we need to move to another room cause they have maintanence so we had to pack again for a moving the light in a room was broken furtinture was a bit dirty but the food was nice i wouldnt suggest that place staff have to leard how to talk with the customerslast weekend i stayed at the golden tulip hotel everything exceeded my expectation from the arrival to the check out everything is perfectrooms are clean specious comfortable the team at the reception were amazing and so professional surely i will stay at the golden tulip hotel whenever i am in dubaihave been travelling to dubai for almost 10 years for business this had to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed at 1 charged 170 dirham for airport collection car was a dirty toyota dropped off in the golden tulip bus with a driver that thought he was a racing driver save your money and get collected from a normal taxi at half the price 2 hotel staff were rude unhelpful and not professional 3 air fresher throughout the lobby and lift that stinks 4 ac unit noise i switched it off and open the window 4 breakfast is disgusting sausages are cheap and processed 5 they only serve filtered coffee for breakfast that is so nasty you cant drink it i asked for a cappuccino and was told there would be charge for it 6 the hotel was full of tourists from a particular region in central asian this is not i repeat not a hotel for business travelers or travelers from western northern central and southern european 7 used the pool upstairs is was dirty with broken tiles sauna changing rooms had broken toilets very poor hygiene 8 bathroom in room was dirty  mold in shower area and broken tiles 9towels were hard excessive use you would get better conditions staying at a cheap motel travel lodge on the freeway 10 could not meet clients or potential clients at the hotel as it was embarrassment i held meetings at the holiday inn around the corner 11 this is not a 4 star hotel very far from it 12

compact breakfast area6 small root top pool7 away from heart of dubaioverall a good budgeted staybooked for this property for 5 days only but because of superb customer services provided by shihab ami lyn aziz and nita decided to extend for 2 more days this is a budget hotel but it did not matter since the front desk fb and even the house keeping provided warm accommodation to me please recognized the hard work of shihab ami lyn and nita even all the pilipino staff from the house keeping from they are warm and lovely i will book back from this hotel if chances permitpoor bar with indifferent staff there are much better bars locally for just a 10 minute taxi ride to barsha heights dont waste your time here ive lived in dubai over 6 years and for some reason bars in al barsha have a poor standard of service for some reasonworst hotel i have ever stayed upon checkin nobody opened the door for us as they were busy with phone upon checkin receptionist was so rude whereas lady duty manager was so polite and offered upgrade to suite room during winters pool was not heated so we had to leave as it was very cold we ordered food from room service the portion was very generous with reasonable prices breakfast not really nice not many options and staff was only focusing on clearing the tables rather than focusing on service staff has poor knowledge we went to the bar and asked the waitress to put the bill in the room as we were inhouse guest and we had deposit she replied that they only accept cash or credit card overall very bad experience first and last time poor hospitality no enough staff i have to carry my luggage by myself and then i was surprised that they dont even have valet had to park my car when i was booking it says with breakfast after i paid and i went to the reception they said no its excluded i was really disappointed with everything all i know is that i ll never go there againwent to this hotel in september and it was actually better than i thought it would be the room given was spacious and clean they have a nice rooftop pool which is quiet good for relaxing the beds are comfortable giving you a good nights sleep there wasnt much noise from the locker room or the sports bar the morningafternoon staff are wonderful especially lyn shes wonderful if you need anything she will help you out no problem and actually seems like she wants to help you and make things better possibly the best receptionist ive ever come across the breakfast could do with more variety however it was good enough for my stay also the breakfast staff are lovely and polite they have a 5gb wifi limit per device max 2 in your room which i thought ran out alot quicker than 5gb usually would however i got this reset by speaking to the reception the late eveningearly morning staff are terrible honestly if you have a problem wait till the morning they are unhelpful so rude and act like they own the hotel one of the receptionist faizan tried to do me over and make me seem like i was dumb but when i returned with email evidence from the hotel he had no choice but to sort the problem out for meanyways apart from the problem with the late eveningearly morning staff evening else was perfectly fine its a very good location so close to the metro too would definitely stay againall staff at the reception ewas very helpful and understand our expectation the hotel has always lift problem every time maybe because the management changed and no action takenwe complain to reception but they cant do anythingi stayed in this hotel for 5 days i met ali at the front desk at my check in and he was very friendly the male staff especially at the front desk are very friendly mostly the ones available when i get there room service and house keeping on point i visited during ramadan so prices were very pleasing definitely going back when i visit dubai this hotel has the rudest most unprofessional staff i have ever encoutered very poor customer service the way the respond to the slightest of requests is terrible and their managers are always busy and in meetings so they never attend to customers queriesthe facilities are very poor tooall in all i would highly recommend not staying here or bothering as there is a wealth of better and cheaper options in dubaifriendly staff good experience and a cool place to hangout with friends at the bar easy access to the hotel and good service at the bar makes it another place to keep visiting for drinks and just meet upsvery friendly front desk staff especially big thanks to a receptionist faizan very helpfulhotel is nicecleannear to metrosome staff should be trained such as housekeeping other than that all is fine like 5 star check in and check out service is very slow felt that not enough staff at the reception however the room is very clean and tidy provide bath room amenities hotel has 1 all day dining restaurent call fresh locker room  sports bar and 1 korean restaurent we met savio diaz he take care us with warm hospitality thank you so much everyone who make our stay wonderful i paid to stay for 7 nights but i had to cancel the last night due to flight travel i paid with my credit card and was told i would be refunded as i am speaking this is one month later that i left dubai and golden tulip albarsha has not refunded my money they even dont respond to my mails anymore i am shockedamaizing experience i visited this hotel and stayed in room 202 it was amazing experience the room was goodlocation is excellent near metro station i would recommend this hotel and will definitely go back myselfi am very thankful to mrfaizan and anil both guys provided wonderful servicesthough the hotel doesnt have the facilities and the amenities of a 5 star hotel  nevertheless it has a superb team  excellent customer service and warm attitude  you really feel that you are home away from home  a great location in barsha area  with self parking facility  few nice outlets  a korean restaurant and a bar plus a nice cozy restaurant with a great breakfast  a hotel with a real value for money outstanding staff especially the first encounter with the hotel reservation agent  ms amy   rooms are clean and spacious  a real great experience they book the hotel in amount but they charged extra and they dont able to explain why they charge extra big thieve in dubaii ask them to provide calculations how they charge this amount but they didnt tell anything and just said contact to website from where you booked i have email available with invoice they sent to me once i booked the hotel and actual bill which hotel charge extrawe were welcomed by a very nice polite professional duty manager mr gurleen singh at reception check in mr singh was very helpful from start to end of our stays and was always at hand for any advise and help we stayed 6 knights in a lovely upgraded room  with all the facilitys for self catering as well  our room was lovely and clean  air conditioning was perfectly set to temperature location was perfect near dg metro station  we had booked bed and breakfast  breakfast was not great at all we found it to be lacking taste badly and very small sitting area  but the waiter a china man was great  all the staff were very good helping with luggage  and keeping our room cleaned with all the facilities  swimming pool on roof was lovely and clean and swim pool attendant very helpful with sun beds  clean towels provided each time location is good near sharaf dg metro stationroom size is goodstaff is goodrestaurant serves indian breakfast as wellthere is peculiar smell which comes in lift and parking which can be worked uponregards garima056 4991910good and clean place wonderful breakfast but this room very very small for all the people than stay in this hotelperfect position near the metro stop and 10 min walking to dubai mallif hotel widens this room can be 5 stars in tripadvisori booked this hotel for three from bookingcom for 150 they left dirty glasses in my room after cleaning the room  i complained at front desk the indian guy at front desk was very rude next day it happened again i mentioned to young and tall indian  he said just sorry and they will replace it  which it didnt happened i booked this hotel from bookingcom with 84 rate the hotel seemed good at the beginning but they booked me in a room with broken ac and blocked sink in the bathroom when reported that they started sending me workers to fix the problems asked for another room and it was dirty with diffused lights hose keeping was awful dirty and never clean properly had to complain daily to clean the room the good thing about this hotel is quite and smells good all the time the parking was a junkyard i dont advise anyone to book at this hoteli really would not know where to start i have never seen such horrible staff tayab tharu anil eman and the gm of the hotel mr irshad  i cannot convey strongly enough how disgusting this place and the unprofessional manager is  the management was worst enough  how this hotel is rated as 4 star seeing this bad services its not capable of giving 1 star hotel as well  you will find some comfortable hotel on this value of money very disappointed in the service  dont stay in this absolute dump of hotel i found a cats paw in my pillow cover  very bad experience  recommend to stay to the near hotel cosmopolitian hotel we are very pleased with the staff work professionally quick checkin and quick checkout careful attitude from the rest daily cleaning of the room tasty breakfast the delux room was very nice and even had ironing equipment and a balcony excellent location  close to the metro station there are plenty of shops supermarkets and restaurants in the area and it is quiet and peaceful i recommendgood if youre there for a few nights had no issues checking in although the breakfast bouffet didnt have much varietyhad to cut my trip due to unforeseen circumstances it would have been nice to get a refund for the night i couldnt stay but yeah all in all it was goodthe hotel facilities require urgent maintenance bathroom flush was malfunctioning from time to time and the water pressure is very poor difficult to regulate the air conditioningthe staff is excellent and do their best to make your stay comfortable despite the shortcomings mentioned above special mention should be made of the receptionist tharu room service person at night restaurant staff and the door mangreat hotel near metro station and very accessible employees are very polite and approachable specially mr faizan and ms eman  it was such a memorable stay for us  thanks to them the only thing i can suggest is that they should extend the pool timing as 6pm onward is a great time to swim _stayed here for 2 nights in nov 2018 chosen because of location near to grand millenium hotel which has a couple of very good bars rooms were of an average size but clean and well appointed all in all the hotel is in very good condition rooms attractive and decent bathrooms including a large walk in shower complete with large rain shower head beds and pillows were very good extremely comfortable pool area is a bit small but we still managed to grab two loungers but only just pool is for chilling only not big enough to do any lengths free breakfast which was adequate not great but enough choice for most peopleworst hotel ive stayed in  it wasnt easy to check in in this hotel  more than 5 hours waiting from 12 noon without any excuse no manager to take a decision in this hotel  no safety deposit boxes in rooms no sob toilet in the lobby it looks like staff toilet  hot water constantly running out in my room  no ventilation in the bathroom  balcony are closed also window or any extractor fan leaving the bathroom misty after taking a shower and leaving it smelly extremely difficult to communicate with hindi language  beds were uncomfortable we slept on the floor   pillows were solid hurting your neck when you sleep with hair and stain  room was dust central the dust had settled everywhere and even after us wiping it off with some baby wipes it would resettle under the bed was filthy with dirt and dust looked like it had been forgotten about by the cleaner  bed sheets were filled with dust when we asked boy saying no staff only 1 in the floor if we could have them changed he replied well the cleaner has finished very bad whos going to do it  fridge was dirty and horrible and the bottom of it was rusty  staff funny when you leave hotel to eat or drink out i could go on but out going to waste any more time i have honestly never been anywhere and met such rude staff in the desk i dont wanna give this hotel any stars but i cant post without 1 star this place shouldnt pop up in any hotel searches its like the bermuda triangle only concierge and mr florintino very helpfuli found a really good deal during ramadanthe hotel is in the centre of al barsha and a good location for metro linereception team are good and there was one morrocan lady in the restaurant who gave great servicerooms are so poor and there is ladies of the night everywhere in the hotel from the bar and walking through the corridors knocking on the doorsthe worst part of my stay was the attitude of the night manager mohamed i have never seen worse customer service in my life and a very poor attitude i wrote to the gm and he never replied i also checked him on linkedin and he seems to be a marketing guy not a hotelier post everyday on linkedin without responding to his guests  poor showworst guest service ever facedshame to mrfaizan as being an front office attendant had worst guest handling skillspoor attitudenot recommended for any guest who looking for good hospitality and genuine staffworse hotel we have ever stayed instaff were horrible tooalso no hot water to have a shower either through out our stay  they lied to us and we have been told maintanance

at golden tulip al barsha decent hotel clean rooms and good service check in at midnight with my daughter and slept well requested for extended check out which thaler did without any hesitation appreciate the service thank youas management consultant i travel a lot and i have seen many hotels in dubai this one is exceptionally bad for the reasons listed below1 their free internet is incredibly slow you will barely manage to update your email or run google search for the decent internet they charge money 50 aed per day absolutely unacceptable for business travelers 2 room cleaning is horrendous i found things that belonged to previous guest and during room cleaning they did not change my bed sheets or provided second towel 3 they do not provide basic necessities that every hotel has like toothbrushes or soap bars4 water in the hotel is barely warm  the weather outside during my stay 37 degree so this was really surprising 5 hotel is extremely old  facilities are outdated and i found mold in my room it is unsanitary6 during my stay the only treadmill in the hotel was in nonworking condition 7 when i tried to escalate all these issues to the management the hotel staff ignored me for 5 days until i complained to dtaoverall  do not waste money for this hotel there are so many amazing options for the same rate in dubai  do not spoil your holidaysthe rooms are bad first room was dusty and difficult to breath in and the bed had a mouldy smell second room was better but the toilet was bad the shower and flush water were very weakdont visit this hotel its not same picture all location in hotel not goodmassage at night customer not family place  stay at novotel nearby better went to the locker room bar it is clear that is a spurs bar so make sure you know that if its a match night good friendly bar staff and a decent variety of drinks if you are a spurs fan it rocks on match night (Score: 0.4845)\n",

            "many times im selecting this place for resting before next flight calm and quite not expensive can sleep nicely staff is nice always smiling and ready to help florinda and hannan are always kind and ready to help always you will get best service from them strongly recommending i have now stayed here a handful of times on business and it is a nice little place i would recommend the small rooms rather than the pods however the location is the airport is perfect surrounded by duty free and designer shops and the staff are very helpful highly recommended for short visits or if you have a long wait in the airport for a connecting flight booked a double room with sliding door for my daughter and myself the room was too hot the bed was rock hard which would have been ok if the pillow hadnt been so very uncomfortable and the duvet way too warm a sheet would have been sufficient it was noisy i could hear the call toprayer and people moving about outside my door and electronic noises which i took i think was the pod doors opening i had asked for a wake up call and checked twice with the staff member that we would get one she said we would get a call five minutes before our time was up which didnt seem negotiable in the end someone tapped on our door very quietly about 25 minutes before our time was up and again a few minutes later i would not have heard the tapping if id been asleep it was so quiet it wouldnt have woken me there was a lot of light pollution in the room which didnt encourage me to sleep however my daughter was very tired and slept through all this we then went to get a shower in the terminal but the airport options for showers were not explained to me although i did ask where they were in the end i paid for a shower a few doors down from the sleep n fly only to find there are free showers in the airport and i could have bought a towel apparently at the sleep n fly reception i would not recommend this place if you are a sleeper who is sensitive to noise or light i wont try it againwe had a 10 hour layover in dxb and decided to give this concept a try we werent disappointed the pods are clean and comfortable and itnis amazing what those 2 hours of shuteye can do for you worth every cent most definitely i booked a single sleep pod as i had a 6 hour layover in dubai airport i was disappointed as i wasnt even offered a pillow or blanket and i felt cold and uncomfortable i was given ear plugs but it was still extremely noisy in my opinion a better option would be to use one of the lounges insteadi slept in a single pod should say slept because its impossible to do so the place is so loud you can hear your every neighbor coming and going as well as at times the noises from outside the lounge the bed is a reclining chair and with no pillow so not the most comfortable either i really do not recommend this the staff is nice but you will get the same quality of sleep in an airport chairi had a 10 hour lay over in dubai and booked a pod at first i was aware of soft voices as another person was shown to his pod my bag shoes etc were securely stored underneath me in a storage cubicle under the bed so i was able to relax fully and sleep eye mask and ear plugs are provided along with the option of renting a pillow and blanket the bed was comfortable and the sleep made the rest of my journey breeze as i was rested and relaxed service by clyanne was tops  thank you highly recommendedi had a 16 hour lay over and decided to not leave the airport but to sleep in the emirates business lounge was unable to do so with all the noise and uncomfortable daybed looked online and saw that sleep n fly have a special price on bookingcom if you book 7hrs from 1pm to 8pm even after reading some of the reviews i decide to try it out of desperation booked the little room with taxes was dhs 20650 for 7hrs took a sleeping pill and slept for 6hrs woke up twice but not because of noise or anything it was quite but i was there during quite time for the airport bedding was clean and staff friendly room is small but there is 3 hooks to hang bags on and under small side table i was able to fit my carry on this room do have a pull out bed for short kids but that means the little bit of floor space you have will be occupied i recently had an extended transit at dubai airport and thought i share my overall experience at this huge airport i arrived at a gates and had a departure from b gates so i checked the various options available inside the terminal the 5 star airport hotel looked great but was beyond my budget snoozecube looked good on the internet but they moved to d gates which was two shuttle train rides away from where i was the airport information counter referred me to the marhaba lounge at either a or b gates both apparently have a couple of tubelike sleeping pods which i could have booked on the spot they looked super comfy private and spacious but apart from the charge for the pod i also had to pay for the lounge access allowing me access to the buffet and drinks which i didnt really care about since i was just tired my final choice was another kind of pod in a sleep lounge called sleep n fly at a gates in the duty free area they called them igloo pods and they were kind of an airline business class seat which goes all flat and with a privacy shade they also have cabins with double beds but for single travellers like me the pod turned out to be the perfect choice mind you the place is not cheap either i guess you pay for the convenience of sleeping right in front of the flight gates rather than wasting 2 hours of return travel time to the surprisingly cheap hotels outside the airport the place isnt 100 quiet given its location but it gave me all i needed since i was so tired from my long flight and i had a good 6 hours of horizontal sleep in relative peace and quieti just spent 8 hours in a pod as part of a 15 hour layover in dubai the pods are as comfortable as older style business class seats they fold out flat but with 3 divisions so it is possible to sleep however the area is noisy as people come and go so using the provided earplugs is essential the main con is the fact that there are no toilets in the facility and you have to get up get dressed and go out into the main terminal and walk 100 yards to a public toilet the other big con is the add on charges no pillow or blanket are provided so you have to buy if you want a shower you will be sold a towel and soap and directed to the public showers near the toilets all this can easily double your costaustralians accept travel discomfort and tedious waiting times  its just a fact of international travel for us i hoped for something better here but sadly my lifelong fear of dentists and their moveable chairs of torture or becoming trapped in dungeon came alive here i wish i could be kind as the staff were nice but i found this a truly alarming and wallet gouging experience th capsules arent beds at all theyre dentist chairs with a sliding curved coffin style lid the horror its dark which is a plus but noisy and uncomfortable tiny and im only 51  everyones trying so hard to be quiet it works in reverse and meanwhile the lady who wakes her sleeping patrons taps past in high heels in an endless round of clacking i slept approximately one minute of my four hour stay  with a sleeping tablet  the rest i spent wrestling the chair or simply tossing and turning in total discomfort i could have achieved for free outside no sheets blankets or pillow unless you purchase them theres no toilet or shower amenities and they wouldnt allow my hand luggage the coffin lid was slammed shut on me before i could retrieve a single thing i needed all the airport noise gets through and if youre near reception your going to hear all the gossip sorry sleep n fly you arent the solutionhad a good 4h stay during a stopover and enjoyed it a bit like business class on the ground the travel pillow and blanket package i bought came very handy in the pod and on my connecting flight with flydubai which is low cost without any amenities on board good choice will do again next time i travel via dubaihaving a 10hr stop over between flights my friend and i decided to try the single pods for some sleep before our connecting flightwe arrived at 2200hrs and booked for 7hrs we had additional costs for a pillow and a blanket which worked out around 75 eachthe pods with a reclining chair that goes flat were noisy cold and very uncomfortable which resulted in no sleep whatsoever there are no wash facilities or toilets so we had to use the public toilets and showers please avoid these at all costs you will have a more comfortable night in an airport chairone of the worst sleeping experieces ever not acceptable value for money even taking the high rates on dubai airport into consideration wouldnt recommend to anyone i regret i didnt sleep on the rest chairs in the airport  it would be probably betterthe igloos are so close to each other that i could hear the person snorring in the igloo next to me even with the ear plugs in my ears i could hear the slamming of the door of the yawn cabins so many times that it was absurd the personel that was showing other customers to their igloos was wearing high heel shoes that were knocking on the floor on every step every time any person was opening or closing the igloo near by the loud sound of the sliding of the cover was disturbing my sleep the airport announcements that dubai airport is a silent airport could also be heard every time they were repeated they dont give pillows or covers you have to pay additionally for that and the set costs as much as 1 hour of sleeptwo enthusiastic thumbs down the team double booked our room and then promised me a refund of 440 which they have never transferred  very unethical service try heading to the bar down the corridor the couches are much comfier and you can get a cool drinkbooked this on bookingcom had a double bed for 4 hours during a 7 hour stay at dxb airport in my route back from la  do after a 16hour flight this was exactly the type of rest i was looking forthere are some negatives the room are tight  so if youre heavy on had luggage you wont have space to stand  the wifi advertised was spotty however if youre going to sleep then why do you need wifi on bookingcom it was made to appear to have showers and toilets facility  that is not really accurate they are nearby but you actually have to use the public toilets  the walls are paper thin so one its not a place to get a room an talk which is obvious with the purpose of the hotelhaving said the above i enjoyed my stay it was what i neededmy recommendation is that they provide complementary water in the rooms as one aiways needs that during traveli was woken up with complementary refresh towels was a nice touchthis is the most disappointing experience ive ever had in dubai the pod was way too warm uncomfortable and the incessant noise of the electric motors was torturous not even a minute of sleep dont waste your moneyi was flying from wellington to glasgow so at this stage of the trip i was the end of the second flight in the last leg being a 14 hour flight from melbourne and arrived in at 0530 into a busy airport and my connecting flight wasnt until the afternoon i thought this was good value although it does seem a bit weird inside a cocoon so it is not for the claustrophobicthe key thing is do i sleep  the answer was i had at least a good two hours of full on sleep the second question is would i do it again absolutelya couple of tips thoughrent the pillow  it will helpbuy a blanket they dont rent them and although in the first half hour you think why did i do that after a couple of hours youll notice itbring ear plugs  i didnt and wish i had you do hear some airport announcements coming through in fact they were in my bag but i was too tired to look for themget the shower kit  the showers are public showers a metres down and although so so as a shower  any shower is good after 20 hours in the air the shower kits come with shower sandals and everything you needso great idea and i would do it again if i had a layover it felt so much betteri thought the price was pretty good  heaps cheaper than a hotel and no hassle the staff were great they even went back to the pod to double check i hadnt forgotten anythingthe best thing about the hotel is its location probably the cheapest sleep option within dubai airport without any other facility we stayed in double bed cabin rooms are very small but sufficient for sleeping during 67 hrs layover they provided blanket and pillowsno restroom shower room and drinking water not even a wash basin are available within the property we need to walk few meters to access public facility outside the hotel free airport wifi was available within the room but rooms are not noise free some of the airport announcement was audible from roomthis is seriously a big fat jokeyou get a dentist chair in a cigar box to sleep in you can hear the hole airport and the people next door snoring even when the prayer goes off you can hear itthe hooting small trucks you name it and they say they got wifi well thats not working never doing that again or recommend to anyone i booked a pod for 4 hoursafter a 12 hour flight and in anticipation for a 15 hour layover in dubai the price is expensive but try and find a hotel less than 200 usdthe staff was extremely friendly and i found the pod small but cozy if you dont like small spaces dont reserve a pod here make sure to bring earplugs and a sleep mask they will sell you a pillow and blanket but bring your own depending what airline you fly you may have just gotten yourself onethis pod got me through my rough layover by providing a quiet place to take a nap if you need more than that you may be better off in a hotel thats literally what these are plus the lady at the reception didnt warn us about this and told us to go out and calm our baby every time she cried all this after paying about 200 try doing that with a cranky 9 month old who was extremely overtired and exhausted and needed some peace and quiet to sleep we tried this for about half an hour and gave up got them to refund the full amount anyway you cant sleep in peace because the sheets are uncomfortable the room claustrophobic and the walls are made of paper you can literally hear people snoring in other pods dont waste your money on these total rip offi am a frequent traveller at dxb and purposely tried sleep n fly twice now instead of a proper hotel i think its a cool place albeit not perfect but you get what it says on the tin the rooms are tiny but comfy and all i need for a transit nap although not cheap after checking them out during my 1st visit the 2nd time i booked a pod which reminds me of the business class seats on my emirates flight my company unfortunately doesnt book for me so i had a bit of a business class experience on the ground i really like the hot towel served at wakeup and the staff is very friendly too but the wifi can be a bit patchy at times i will gladly return next time probably i take a pod again since i usually travel on my own and the price is lowerdidnt qualify for dubai connect this time and i had a 21 hours layover so had no option but to go for sleep n fly lounge the place just provides sleeping pods or small rooms do not expect water or any other facilities even it does not have a washroom bed is good but quite noisyi had read the reviews and still booked a room not a pod i must stress managed to get a few hours sleep during a long layover in dubai airportbed was comfortable and ambience pleasant staff friendly and efficient would stay again and recommend if you need a few hours sleep or a lie down between flightsnot the quietest of places but that depends on the other people stayingi booked the pod which is a bit cramped go with the room instead even for a single persona lot of upsells book through the booking websites rather than their own website as the prices are a lot differentthis facility is very helpful if what you need is a quiet and safe place to lay your head in an almost flat pod the basic units are about 5 foot across and 11 foot deep with a height sufficient to stand a solid screen is pulled down once you are inside the pod there seems to be someone ready to awaken you if that is your request the price is quite cheap at about 10 us per hour you will be awoken in time for your flight or when youre reserved time comes to an end there are more expensive units comprising greater space with a regular closing door for those who are willing to pay twice the hourly rate those are the plusesthere are some minuses or limitations you must keep in mind the nearest restroom is about 100 feet outside this business area in a public setting this can be quite inconvenient if you awaken and need a rest from during a sleep session there are no showers available prepayment is essential even though there always seem to be space when i have used this service the place is frigid cold and without a blanket it is very uncomfortable blankets and pillow apparently dont come as part of the service the attendant at the front desk seems unacquainted with basic english the noise of people coming and going during your stay seems no more or less then you would experience out in the main terminal it is critical for you to be absolutely sure which terminal you arriving in and which terminal you are departing since you are certainly a transit passenger keep in mind that between concourses you can have as much is a 45minute hike to get to wherever you need to be these sleep pods are opposite gate a in concourse a terminal 3 if this is not the place from which you will arrive or leave then you may be wasting a great deal of time traveling tofrom this rest areai will be returning to this location but only when i know that it is consistent with my arrivaldeparture gateterminalthis is not a hotel but an igloo where 1 can sleep there are no showers and toilets its a sleep only cubicle rated per hour considering the price its best to go downtime if 1 has a visa as the place is on the expensive side i paid 95 usd for sleeping from 23h00 to 7h00 in the morning i had to pay 27 usd for a shower in a close by facility the sleeping chair was not the best and the quality is dependent upon on the person sleeping in the igloo next to you i would suggest if your layover is more than 10 hours look for a hotel close to the airport that has a free shuttle even with the transit visa of 50 usd it would work out cheaper and sleeping or resting may be betterdid not enjoy experience that did not give you waterthey dont have bathroom on premises and you have to leave your sleep pod to go outside and use the public toilets and showers on the airport the pod is to tiny and they do not give you a blanket and the temperature inside the sleep and fly is coldi booked this for my dad because he didnt get a complimentary hotel even though he had 11 hrs transit pissed at that to start with so i found this lounge and booked for 1 person he couldnt sleep all night said it was very cold with very light blanket it was very uncomfortable and got disturbed with people going inout the concept is nice but it is way overpriced for what you get would not recommend100 for 6 hours in the sleeping pod  ouchdont even give a blanket or pillow i was shivering all night the staff is not courteous and talks loudly sometimes worst was after 3 hours of tossing around  when i finally slept  they put a guy who was snoring like an elephant next to me could not sleep a wink i paid for 6 hours but left after 5 they could have moved him to the end of the pod lineup it was nearly empty but no one cared even though the snorer kept rest of us awakei would not recommend for the price way too expensive the minimum they can do is to provide a cozy blanket and pillowi spent a night in an igloo pod last week whilst in transit from addis ababa to lisbon and liked the experience this is not a hotel but i liked the setup a lot despite a few flaws i was aware of i dont understand why some people are so negative about this place i know exactly what i booked and as a result i was happy it did the job for me the pod seat was all flat and for my understanding very comfortable the lack of toilets was clearly stated on bookingcom website and the sometimes noise from my neighbours was fine for me the price i paid was a bit high but i understood that i paid for the location inside the transit area and it saved me hours of clearing immigration and customs and the long hotel shuttle bus rides and waitingi have used this service now 3 times twice using a yawn cabin with my wife once using the igloo pod alone each layover has been around 79 hours and i have booked for 2 hour time slots i once had a 10 hour layover and just left the airport and stayed at a hotel close by the good worthwhile if you want to get a couple of hours of rest  get away from the crowds anything more than a few hours i would use the terminal hotel if you need to get actual sleepthe bad i have been in summer and the air conditioning struggles to keep the place cool unsurprisingly there is no ambient noise so you hear everyone else coming in and out of their cabins  pods i think they could easily put in a white noise generator or something similar to muffle those sounds if you are travelling with kids then i would also use the terminal hotel as the sleepn fly has no individual bathroomsthe staff will check your next flights boarding pass to ensure you can make the connection and they will wake you up 5 mins prior to the end of your booked time slotthere is room inside both the cabins and the pods to store carry on bags and charge any devicesso the thing is when youve been on a long haul flight and youve been sat in economy seats all the way where even the recline makes you sit upright your body is yearning for a clean flat something to lie on and rest your head and lower back this is what the pods provide little more than this there is noise they are not sound proofed you can even hear bags being dragged outside the sleeping lounge area but its a private place to rest your head your back and get some time to yourself its not a hotel room dont expect it to be but it may be just enough for what your body needs keep expectations low and you may well be satisfied especially on a time and day when dubai airport is chaos and packed full (Score: 0.4638)\n",

daily basis by the housekeeping staff and they cared about the quality of their work the restaurant was clean and presentation was fantastic the breakfast buffet was plentiful on the serving line or one could opt for the continental breakfast consisting of fresh fruits breads and granola cereal the lunch and dinner buffets plentiful and nutritious along with fresh fruits pastries and juicesthe restaurant staff all performed their respective duties in a professional courteous manner i would like to single out jocelyn a waitress at the restaurant a sweet and charming person always with a

is a vital asset to the operational staff at the premier inn international hotel dubai uaei would definitely stay at the premiere inn again in the futurewonderful to stay with your hotel just bed was not prepared well need bed preparation training to housekeeping describe the service you experienced good tell us how you liked the room good talk about the location  amenities good say what you liked best  least food my family had a recent long layover in dubai i chose premier inn mainly for the proximity to the airport and the good reviews i saw it was a very good choice we arrived about 5 am and had a scheduled checkin for 2 pm the staff was very helpful and allowed us to check in early at no extra charge this was great and allowed us to get a little rest before sightseeing from the shuttle drivers to front desk staff you could see they were committed to making sure guests had a great experience the room was very clean and beds were comfy we didnt have any meals there so i cant speak about that the room was stocked with a minifridge water and coffeetea making ingredients i would definitely stay at premier inn again the staff made my familys first visit to dubai a very pleasant onewe booked one night at premier inn to cover our 17 hour stop over in dubai getting to and from the hotel was so easy in the shuttle bus and the staff were lovely and welcoming our stay allowed us to relax and recharge and i would highly recommend premier inn to anyoneshuttle service is available through out day n night breakfast is complementary and goodhave a small swimming pool on top property is very clean and perfect room are spacious but beds are very hard value for moneythe hotel promised early checkin  priority was given to new checkin customers while prebooked where made to wait  bedsheets where never changed  room was rush cleaned  no water no towels  receptionist are not helpful and welcoming as they use to be  stayed here many times but the hotel is over booked and maybe thats why they dont seem to care anymore the bedsheets where never changed once during our 4day stay  only 1 towel and no water  they was a very foul smell in the corridor on the 3rd floor and it remained during our stay nobody bothered to check it  very nice and clean good ambiance shuttle service was remarkable akhila bea  ryan were superb the entire check in process was explained in detailed every amenity offered was explained in detail as well to arrive at a hotel at 1030 am it is extremely rare to get checked in before 2pm they were able to get me check in by 1100 and explained the process and gave me the option of freshening up while i waited left no question unansweredvery clean friendly staff great roof top pool with awesome views very good valuekhem the life guard really looked after usevening buffet was excellent great opportunity to try different foodour first stay was so good we booked another night on our return tripairport shuttle was an added bonus great pick up and drop off location just look for the purple mini buswe really appreciated the comfortable room air conditioning and availability of dinner and breakfast on the premises the free shuttle bus service makes a short stay so much easier a special thanks to the staff bea zankrit akhila and the breakfast staff such a welcome and great servicemy check in experience was very bad booked the room in april called my bank to allow the transaction which they did on getting there was informed that my card was never charged  was i furious they apparently tried to charge a day before  i guess i was midair in my 14 hour flight  no one bothered to inform me because my bank wont allow it unless i call them to authorize the transaction everyone knows how terrible their wifi is so calling my bank was out of question luckily i have another card from my home country  that was the one i used otherwise i wouldve been stranded with two kids because someone did not do their job well that checkin experience left a bitter taste in my mouth i just did not get around to appreciate the hotel 55 for all aspects with the exception of the baby cot being old dirty and rippedif it was the uk the cot would have been scrapped long ago dont let it put you off though because everything else is spot onthe building is dated but like i say its a good hotel for close to the airport stays and the food and staff are very very goodthe hotel is right across from dubai international airport and its a short drive away and its priced reasonably for a quick stay its very clean and the beds are comfy and the staff are friendly and helpful especially alice and amy they took care of us me and my partner the last time we stayed there over the weekendi wasnt expected to stay in dubai for a night but i was lucky to crash over on their bed it was one of the best beds i ever had speaking of the cleanliness it likes your home if i have another layover ill definitely book again i stayed there for one night it was really awesome stay neat and clean room check in  check out was really smooth breakfast options were amazing pure professional team mr riaz of maintenance is a amazing person to have in team booked a overnight stay for transit by mistake i choose the wrong date at a non refundable rate but bookingcom and the hotel allowed to cancel for freehotel offers free shuttle service 247 a nice pool on the rooftop staff was always friendly and helpful would totally recommendi booked premier inn for a 3 day stopover and enjoyed the stay the shuttle service made it easy arriving late night with a child i didnt have to look for taxi also getting back to the airport for my departure the shuttle service to deira is provided by someone different and it wasnt as pleasant as the premier shuttle though the hotel is opposite the airport there was no noise it is well soundproofed room was clean and comfortable and extra bed provided at no extra cost for the family room i found the breakfast to be expensive but up to 2 children eat free for a paying adulti have a transit flight so i spent one night at premier inn dubai and they give us free shuttle bus from airport and to some malls so i recommend this place for people who want to stay short time enjoy perfect for stopover shuttle bus service 2for 1 offers on food  drink friendly  helpful staff clean  comfy room fast  efficient checkin have stayed here before en route to australia  will stay againi stayed in this premier inn for one night as a stop over for a flight the staff were extremely friendly we were served by zanhrit who couldnt of been more helpful the room was very clean we ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner and it was beautiful one of the nicest steaks we have ever had again the staff couldnt of been more helpful my friend who lives in dubai joined us for dinner and was very impressed by the menu and said she would 100 go there to dine again there is also a pool hot tub and gym on the top flooroverall this hotel was great value for money and we couldnt thank zanhrit and the rest of the staff enough for making us feel so welcome we will be staying again on our way home for thailandthe hotel is good as a very convenient location for those who have continued flights through dubai airport very close to the airport the hotel offers free buses from and to the airport every hour the rooms are simple but the price is very suitablethis is like any other premier inn hotel however it is so close to the airport that it makes for a great value lay over spot very little aircraft noise

grace at the reception for her professional and quick assistance breakfast is excellent and offer a wide selection you will probably be greeted by jocelyn she always smiles and always make sure you dont leave hungry haha she is also good to personalize her approach and remembers your preferences mine is the strawberry yogurt lol to end my review the most important point and not the least is the cleaness of the room always clean and comfortable thanks to soc from the cleaning team who ensured high level of standardsthe hotel is simply the best for service and accommodation to all airport terminals it is the choice for flight crews the bar and restaurant are equally great welcoming jocelyn adds to the service and freshness of both with a smile attentiveness and beauty premier inn excels in all ways value access and location people especially and especially jocelyn who always makes each guest feel like they will always want to come backquite atmosphere and staff were friendly but the blankets and bed sheets were not good and they smell the shuttle to nearby malls pass by many hotels before going to anywhere it is better to go by a taxicab and save your time and comfort very good hotel  was very clean rooms  near to the airport  very easy transfer by bus from airport to the hoteland from hotel to airportvery good stuff in reception and very friendlyrecommended very mucha great place to be in dubai media city a watering hole for all the media city people binson and arvind are the rockstar bartenders ready to serve with a smile every time you want a drink great for watching football and cricket games all through the yearnice and pleasant one night stay so nothing to complain the best value is free airport shuttle i can haihly recommend this hotek for those who are traveliing i will choose your hotel when i visit dubai againwas nice comfortable stay overnight but the staff didnt wake me up for my flight as i was going to miss my flight and i already requested for a wake up call my family was with me my wife and 5 kids so i woke up by my self at 7 and the flight was at 825amthe hotel is rated 3 stars it should be rated 5 stars always genuine services provided atmosphere is very delightful staff is always courteous i always enjoy my stay pricing is well rounded to provide the tourist the most for their dollars spent the premier inn is no doubt centrally located in the idea location to access the airport quickly the drivers who run the shuttle is always eager to provide assistance to the tourist i fully think the premier inn is the best hotel in the uae when it comes to attending to the tourist and providing services thank you premier innnice hotel to stay room was very nice staffs were good and excellent overall it was an awesome stay at hotel when i decided to extended my stay i thought it will be difficult to get the room but the staff helped me out and got the room easyso im writing this review just after ive been trying to get to sleep for the last 30 minutes i havent been able to sleep because the pillows are just awful theyre itchy theyre flat and just downright painful to sleep with just after 30 minutes of trying my neck is aching really badly and is in agony which isnt very beneficial for me due to the simple fact that ive got a 9 hour flight tomorrow at 9 in the morning so im going to be tired or even exhausted if youd like along with a agonisingly painful neck this is just great i have been to many different premier inns throughout my travels and this one is the worst one that ive ever stayed in by far usually the sleep experience is what premier inns are normally known for however this one embarrasses the hotels reputation by putting their guests who pay for a good nights sleep in pain overall i do not recommend this premier inn for anyone whos looking to stay here unless you want your neck to be put in painnice and friendly staff great location to airport and other things you have a shuttle service not to just the airport but to other popular locations around dubai rooms clean well lit great channel selection nice restaurant bar and coffee shop in hotel the location of the hotel is great near the airport and free shuttle bus directly to the terminals special thanks to khaldoon walaa mahmood alice nitin akila zikrit amy bia and narayan from front office and renglyn from

for family nearby there is a mini mall where there is supermarket mcdonalds and cafes it is a distance to the dubai metro alkarama and taxis are very hard to get herewe have stayed this hotel in may13 a good descent hotel in burdubai area good hotel for families and couples walking distance to alkarrama metro station from where you get the connectivity almost every tourist destination breakfast is goodnot too many choices and they have some indian selection also spinneys supermarket is few steps awaywe stayed in this hotel for 3 days very few taxiwalah knows this hoteleverytime you have to tell taxiwalah landmarks line spinneys or golden sands etcbreakfast is always with one dish of boiled potatoes alu not a good menu  at all extra bed metalic charpayi bed was given to me i felt as if i was accompanying a patient in a hospitali dont know the tariff of this hotel since we had taken air arabia packagei would warn everyone taking air arabia package to dubai not to take this hotel for stay in dubai hotel london creek aptbur dubaisometimes i feel i was fooled by air arabiahotel is about 15mins to al karama metro3 mins to spinneys supermarkettaxis sometimes hard to get if kasim the bellboy is around he can help uno free wifi minimal fee appliesrooms are basicsabit steep for the price u payaverage breakfastwashing machine is working but be aware there no dryerwe have stayed in london creek in 2008 but thia time we were in for a shockthe rooms are run downmusty smell with cigarett burns on the carpetthe wshing machin erefused to spin and the manager din seem concerned tt i had wet clothes the kettle blew up wen i plugged it init could be tht i was unlucky however the least tbe manager could ve done was tk chnage our room while thy tried to fix the washing machinenever goin back to london creekchecked in late dec 2010 till early jan2011stayed with my family in two rooms connecting decent rooms with basic facilities hotel staff great and well behaved  nice neighbourhod howevernot much to offer for children and grounds not large enough to move around will recommend to others  may be backi was in dubai for a friends wedding and stayed at london creek they sent a complimentary cab to pick me up from the airport on arrival i had to wait almost an hour to get the room keys i feel like the front office is understaffed considering they have to deal with the newly arrived guests and also cater to phones ringing off the hook the room was fine small bathroom small kitchen with cutlery items one issue was that i had booked a room with twin beds since a friend of mine was also going to stay over for a night but they gave me a double bed i called them up 34 times and they kept telling me to give them 30 mins and they would change the room but they never did the best thing about this place is its location very close to a 24 hr supermarket and also very close to the karama metro station if not for the comparatively cheaper rates i wouldnt go backseriously is the worst hotel ive ever stayed at got there and room was filthy and stunk also didnt have washing machine as mentioned when booking bathroom had mould there was loose wiring in kitchen bedsheets were filthy walls had damp marks all over them will upload pics soon we asked to change rooms and were shown 3 others and they were in exactly the same condition when asking for a different room the staff werent surprised by my comments on the room seemed like theyd heard it all before  finally got a different room on the 5th floor the next day which was a lot better found staff to be very rude and arrogant only members of staff that actually spoke to us during our 8 days there were the cleaner and the male nightshift receptioniststayed here for days and was not impressed neither with the cleanliness nor the rotten silicon around the bathtub the smell of indian scent made me run through the corridors not breathing worried to vomit ac goodwe booked on bookingscom our reservation was for 2 adults and 1 child on arrival we went to the front desk to check in it looked as though the two people at reception had a fall out she rolled her eyes at him and he was very miserable to us which i suppose should have tipped us off to what the rest of our stay would be like when we got to the room we were a bit put off but i checked the bedding and it was clean so decided to stay after spending a bit more time in room 407 we began noticing the grossness the bedrooms walls are filthy the curtains untidy and smelly the mats on the floor were filthy too when checking the phone book to call a taxi the dust on the cover was beyond shocking the entire bedstand hadnt been cleaned in ages the dust was so thick the room with the iron was also dirtyonto the lounge the couch was dirty the mat was dirty and the table hadnt been wiped down from the previous peoples coffee cupsreception staff were slow our kettle wasnt working so i called for a replacement it was quickly replaced but when i saw we had no bedding for the filthy broken sleeper couch i called reception again 3 times i made the request for bedding they didnt seem to care that i had a child that needed to sleep our first call was at 6pm 2045 it was received there are also no plugs in the bathroom for the bathwe should have known room service wouldnt be good the chips were either burnt or the oil they were fried in old probably old as it seems to me tht everyone in this establishment is too lazy to get upbreakfast was included but rather unappealingwe chose this place because of its location and price we have paid less for much better accomodation in the same area and even if its not the best accomodation i expect it to be clean this is the worst place we have ever stayed and will never recommend it to anyone and never stay there again whoever owns the london creek should seriously rethink the management staff absolute shockerever heard if not experienced a hotel cancelling your reservation since some others have simply extended their stay not sure if one should say worse or comic when it happens twice the first time it happened due to a hockey team i was told guess this time its a football team however the decision making is anything but sporty infact its the most unprofessional i have seen how would you react when you hear a hotel say that although you may land at xx hrs at the hotel and inspite having a confirmed reservation we cannot estimate how long you will have to wait until a room is provided to you how is that a confirmed reservation thenoff all the smart communication i was asked sir why do you take flights that land in the morning before our regular check in  out times i was confused between deciding to laugh or get angry the official communication written and oral from the reservation dept is a joke do not take them seriously else your bp levels will run a rioti have many more words to say about this hotel however they all share the same tone  negative to say the least and control myself to be as polite in such a public forumwill not waste my time and effort if i were you in contacting this hotel you may receive a confirmation letter only to be cancelled few days before your actual travel i would not recommend this hotel even if you were the kinds that loved adventure this was our first time to dubai and this hotel was the last stop on 7 week european holiday this hotel was the worst ever the service at reception appalling a woman and 2 mean stood chatting to each other and didnt seem to notice customers waiting we had 2 rooms booked a triple bed room and a double room for our family of 5 we ended up with 2 rooms with a double bed on each they said they would bring a mattress after waiting all day and asking several times the mattress turned up well after 7pm our children were very tired by now we onlyhad 1 towel in one room and 2 towels inthe other room very stained and old towels and bathroom filthy with mould everywhere the room smelt too very disappointed with our firstimpression of dubai would never recommend this hotel to anyonewe stayed for 3 days 4 nights in the london creek hotel in october 2013first of all we only got 2 single beds when we booked for 3 then were given a terrible quality stretcher after we had to request itsecond the bedside lamp did not work the lights in the bathroom did not go had to ask for these to be rectified which took a daythird dirty the room was not cleaned properly and there was still hair around in the bathroomfourth one of us was confronted by two young woman at the pool and demanded our bags they did not succeed they were not from the hotel so security is poorwe will never be going back and do not recommend this hotel to anyonei was planning to stay there for a month until i find my own apt when i walked in the room omg sooo dirty the floor in the room just a tile no carpet seems like hadnt been washed for a month the smell in the room and in the bathroom was soo awful dirty spots in the kitchen i called front desk asking for another room the answer was that there were no available then i told them i am going to cancel my stay there is because to live in such dirt is unecceptable the hotel manager called and asked to wait an hour until they will prepare another room 3 hours later i went to check another room same thing if the hotel is dirty it is dirty in every room the housekeeper manager was with me when i was looking at another room i showed him the dirty spots in the kitchen and bathroom he just said  oh well i cancel my stay there and moved to the apartments across the street who charged less had much spacious clean room my advise  stay away from that horrible placebad location contaminated air water tap are not working hotwater is not working room services are very harsh and bad the worest issue was the noise around the room the room size is good clear no  good it was nice holiday with my wifewe enjoyed it nice location expecialy we can go easly from the hotel for the purchesing or nice restaurants everthig here closer staffs also very good service expecily frount office staffthe only positive thing is the location  2 mints walk from spinneys and 5 mnts from carrefour between two metro stations  burjuman and adcb lots of restaurants for all types of pockets on the other side of the roadrooms lighting are very depressing bathrooms are not well maintained i have lived in this hotel multiple no of times as it was directly booked by the company i will not waste my own money on such kind of poor service in all the rooms i have lived in all the bathroom drainage leaked every time i had a shower the bathroom floor used to get flooded kitchen switches are broken in most rooms apart from a couple of maintenance and front desk staff rest of the maintenance staff were out right rude refused your requests one time i had a problem with the toilet seat which would not simply stand the maintenance guy saw that and bluntly told me its not supposed to stand only after i asked to see his manager he repaired it some of the housekeeping staff often refuse towels if you have asked them to come after sometime for room cleaning they would often no come till evening and when reminded in the evening they would tell i asked in the morning you told no now i donot have timethe breakfast is terrible it gets repeated every twothree days the options you had have are alu paratha on oneday upma on another puri bhaji on another puri halwa on another day for nonindian breakfast it rotates between chicken liver chicken sausage baked beans if you are staying for 23 weeks you would probably be able to predict that days breakfast menu internet is pathetic you will not be able to browse anything i am not sure if the paid internet is anything better the internet we got was usually included in the room pricenice  clean rooms peaceful atmospherefriendly staff free car parking kitchen fully furnished tea coffee maker in the room location near to metro barjuman mall is on walking distance enjoyed my staywell maintained and clean room and toilets very accessible close to train station and restaurants and shops to buy groceries for kitchen staff was very helpful very quick in going out of way to provide extra service recommended  great value for moneylacation is exellent very near to metro station and mall shopping complex centrally located good food and nice room service again value for money helpfull staff at front desk and room service ill recommend for business family trips and leisure tripswe had a wonderful experience at front desk i want to mention eleonor dominecil particularly she was very helpful knowledgeable and personable every time we needed the information she would google provide direction and suggest the best way to get to place eleanor was the highlight of this hotelthe location of this hotel is terrific close to subway station and the huge supermarket the hotel has a poor wifi the connection is unstablemy wife daughter soninlaw and myself stayed two nights in dubai at this establishment the floors were not vacuumed one bathroom had hair and there were blood stains the second bathroom thee were only enough towels for three people the list of kitchen items listed 4 teacups there was only one and 4 drinking glasses there was one the counter top had sagged and was broken the supervisor of housekeeping indicated that the condition of the floor was good and it was very cleanoutlet did not work in the kitchen hotplate was a mess looks like it needs to be replaced white residue all over the countertop and on the pot to heat water for tea in bathroom around the base of the toilet leaks around the base of the sink leaks hairdryer does not work in the bathtub the only option is to shower as the on top of the faucet is broken and a piece missing enabling the tub to be filled with water no small face towels the tile behind the toilet is broken with a large crack and also the douche shower head also leaks and is plugged up with toilet paper i assume to stop the leak the safe in the closet says to reset code push red button on back of safe well there is no red button no material in the room to find out the amenities of the hotel or menu for room service called the front desk inquiring about a shuttle to the airport and was told i had to call back in the morning and speak to the transportation person when it clearly states on the website that there is shuttle service to the airport mattress on the bed is so hard and only two pillows that are hard too ive also seen bugs that appear to be coming out of the sewer drains the sewer drain cover in the kitchenette is not secured and if you accidentally step on it the cover comes off i would never recommend this placethis was not what i expected of 3 star accommodation it was dilapidated and in great need of a overhaul the shower head fell off the hair dryer was prehistoric and its reinforced tube was held together with plastic tape the toilet seat was wobbly the breakfast was unacceptable and the whole place was depressing to be fair the staff changed our room but that was only marginally better i will read my reviews on trip advisor more carefully next time staying at the london creek hotel is quite acceptable if you are really in to 2 star accommodations what the hotel promises on its website is not exactly what it delivers in actuality a few things one needs to note down is the fact that the hotel is not at all close to any convenience stores basically an apartment or a studio is only useful if you have groceries and other daily essentials close by further to that i will strongly not recommend the property for people who have families as the property is noisy and that will be a problem for quite a lot of people other than that it is clean and the breakfast served is quite ok but not really that great basically what you pay for is what you get and yes for a studio or a one bedroom apartment it is quite spacey but you need to know that the property is quite old but maintained well another drawback that i found was that the inhouse or free wifi is really not that great and i had to tether of my mobile phone for basic emails i tried one day of paid internet out of my 3 day stay there but then realized that the money sent was wasted because the speed was to slow over all i really do not know how to recommend this property but i will not stay there againi had the misfortune to call up this hotel apartment seeking room availability the reservation lady advise me that that rooms are available and advised me the cost i asked her to confirm the booking on the phone and she replied there is no need to book but to come to the hotel and ask for ann and she will give me the room i travel all the way from sharjah to checkin at the counter i was asked to wait and asked for ann lady comes out after 10 minutes and tells me openly that there are no rooms available i told you she joking with me she says no i asked why she did not let me know that there was no room she did not have a reply and she was getting angry i spoke to the sales manager who only justify what the lady said just shooed me away first time in dubai im facing such an experience and i felt let down by both the reservation staff and sales manager who did not even apologise in case they made a blunder please do not book this hotel you will be disappointedthe manager name is rahib husein malek and lady name is annthis place is awesome clean good beds nice kitchen comfortable nice parking  kids friendly pets allowed close to all shopping malls close to a lot of food joints great night clubs and close to bur dubaihi i had stayed in london creek hotel apartmemt last week from 8th feb 2017 to 12th feb 2017 room no 213services offered by hotel was very poormain thing is that during my entire stay at hotel water in bathtub was very yellowishi had complained on first day itself maintenance guy said that he had repaired it but again result was samei had complained multiple times to reception but i was told that hotel doesnt have extra room on the second last day i was told to shift to upgraded room which makes no sense as i had to check out at 12 next day  please never ever go this hoteli checked into these apartments for a 7 night stay as i am here on a business trip i was very nicely greeted by the staff and general manager i had a few enquiries once i had checked into my apartment and they were dealt with quickly easily and to my absolute satisfaction i found aneel the wonderful general manager very attentive kind and gracious towards my requests this is a general manager who 100 cares about his guests satisfaction and he did not disappoint thank you to aneel and the rest of the staff at london creek hotel apartments for making me feel very welcomed special and extremely happy 5 stars for customer service you did a great jobgood service nice rooms good location good food very good staff i was in room no 605 good spacious rooms good wifi speed very friendly location for indian national very near to metro burjuman mall is just on walking distancedated tired and horrible the bathroom had mould and broken tiles the entire place was dirty really dont know how they are still in business please dont let the pictures deceive you service is also bad and the staff rude they expected visitors to guest rooms to present their passportswe stayed hereacross 3 apartments for 3 weeks between dec 13 and jan 14prosgreat location 5 minutes from metro amd 24 h spinneys supermarketgreat housekeeping staffquiet gym sauna and poolbreakfast if you like indian food is serviceablewalking distance to burjumanmall and karama cheap eatstwin bed rooms are largest on 7th floorvery accommodating wrt early checkinconsavoid a room with interconnecting doors as it will be noisy and you can hear all in the next roomlobby area a bit small but very entertaining to watch comings and goingstv channels slightly limitedno free wifi aed 10 dhshour or aed 30 for 12 hours use within a 24 hour periodsometimes you got threadbare towels but these were immediately changed on requestin summary a proactive outfit that serves a conpetent apartment hotel operation be aware of noise as it is frequented by families so ask for a quiet room rooms are not as large as nearby belvedere who has a better lobby area bit for what they have they work it well dont expect frills or contemporarily designed interiors but if you want a basic apartment decorated in 1980s style it does the jobthe stay was good though it was for a very short time and the best part is price of the hotel is cheaper than the expected amount staffs are very loyal and helpful  but little mess about the location for the taxi after getting off the metro station in dubailc has excellent hospitality with friendly staff always ready to help very clean and comfortable rooms with basic amenities provided gym is equipped with the necessary machines as well as the rooftop swimming pool with a nice viewthe location is convenient for familykids as it is close to burjuman mall cinemasfoodcourt etc as well as the metro station which connects you to the entire city supermarkets are located right behind the building as well as spinneys a few minutes awayi am sorry this review has come in late i was hoping to book this again inn may 2014 this is one of the best apartment hotels that i stayed in though i am not to com[plain about any other by name the room service front office and also the restaurant staff are very polite and helpful there is a well stocked super market around the corner from where one could get all essentials and there is a continuous availability of taxis across the road at any time be very mindful about the descriptive web postings of other apartment properties around as i have stayed in a few over the years and did not find them to comply with anything that was offered on many of those web pages this place is value for moneygot to stay here for 5 nights and found it good the wifi was chargeable and that was bad didnt anyways used it the indian food was okay not excellent and the restaurant is really small for our group to accommodate all in one go the bell boy was always smiling and welcoming the swimming pool on the terrace was small but didnt use it as it was cold didnt use the gym either spinneys the super store is close by and so is karama metro stni stayed here around 2 weeks very bad location struggling to get a taxi outside the hotelthis hotel gym equipments arebroken and unsafe to usethis hotel is run by indians especially night shift staffs are prejudice towards other nationalities particularly night shift door man he is very rude and arrogant towards other nationalities with my experience please dont stay herei visited dubai in january as it ws a peak season for them but anybkw we booked this hotel at a good price but after reaching the hotel one of the staffs were not agreeing on the price but anyhow we won and got the room good compact rooms but hes with almost everything in the room just an okay staybefore leaving i checked the reviews of the hotel and was quiet paranoid of staying there after reading the reviews which were very bad however since my husband was already there i had no other option but to join him to my surprise the hotel is very nice clean and has really good facilities including a gym and roof top pool with jacuzzi with an awesome view of the burj khalifa the staff at the reception desk were warm and helpful the room service was quick and the general hygiene was also up to the mark being an apartment hotel it has almost all facilities available in the small rooms with kitchenettes and a small bathroom with a bathtub the metro station and city center are within walking distance from the hotel which makes it all the more convenienti would recommend this hotel to people on business trips or a small family on vacation that wants to cook their own foodi also stayed here for 4 nights with my friends neat and clean hotel good for family  friendal karama metro station is the nearest metrobest part was the gym pool  interconnected room or you can say that we got two bedrooms apartmentbreakfast was very nice and the services was also very greati stayed year a couple of years back and liked the placeit isnt a branded hotel but it proves itself by providing good rooms good facilities a decent breakfast all at an affordable price its location is great quiet surroundings but easily accessible from the metro stationoverall great value for moneyweve stayed at several hotel apartments throughout our years in the middle east and by far this has been the worst experience the hotel promotes free wifi but fail to tell its customers its only in the lobby to add insult to injury the free wifi is only for an hour moreover if one wants wifi in hisher room its 500 dhm for the month our room had two tvsone that worked the other did notquite remarkable considering it was from the early 90s cleaners rarely showed up if at all guests are only allowed in the lobby proper kitchenware wasnt available in the room and the list goes on with the exception of the nice workers in the restaurant cant say much about this place the food was decent for the price one pays at the price at which i bought i cannot complaint wifi i free in lobby for some time rooms are decent  not luxurious there are 2 metro station nearby spinneys is walkable the location i inside and not on the main lane no expectation hotelold non maintained apartments dirty and smelly the noise from the outside did not let me sleep since the windows are old and non isolate at all very poor breakfast with cheap food of doubtful origin no ham or cheese just some cooked rice and clear non flavor coffeethere is only internet at the reception it really spoiled our stay in dubai and the prices are not lowdo not stay at this hotel disappointment guaranteedstayed there in early jan 20152 nights and 3 dayswe had booked 3 roomsthe rooms are finethe hotel is walking distance from a 24 hrs supermarket and from where you also have an indian restaurant the prices are quite low compared to dubai standard and a mc donaldif you like shoppingcentre point is walking distance and when we were there we really had some real discount dsf as compared to the big malls like dubai mall and marina mallthe metro is not so far but still a little bit of walking is requireddubai mall is some 1015 mins by metroyou can also have taxi easily once you are outside the hotelthe hotel has a restaurant and you can order room service also  nothing much to say about it as most of the time i ate outsidei had no issue with the staffit was fine with themi dont know why other people complained so muchbut just too bad i had to pay for my late check out  the swimming pool is quite smallotherwise stay was fine and the hotel is not far from the airportactually i didnt enjoy my stay in this hotel the cleanliness is really bad rooms design is very basic bathrooms are very small no vanity top no free wifi in the rooms and even the paid ones is not working properly whats is good about it that its near the metro station and spinneys supermarket room is very specious but old designed the washrooms are a little turn off as the decor is very old the price is but high maybe because the hotel is located bout 10 mins walk to the train station quite accessible to other shops and bars by walkingthis hotel is a short walk to the metro train station which is very handy if you shop around for rates it is very reasonable i paid 70aud a night and was happy with this it has a rooftop pool and a small gym area with basic equipment i stayed in a studio apartment here which had a large bedroom area full bathroom facilities and a kitchen with stove and appliances it is slightly dated but for the price it serves its purpose very well there is no free wifi in the rooms but it is free in the air conditioned very comfotable lobby there is a restaurant that serves breakfastdinner in the lobby also the staff spoke english and many other languages the desk clerk aukni i think thats how its spelt was very helpfulwe only had 2 nights in this hotel which was enough the bathroom tiles were mouldy with water coming up from the drain in the floor and the shower curtain was also quite grubby the breakfastdinner room located opposite the reception area was small we had breakfast there on one morning and didnt bother going back the next day even the room service menu in the room was dirty and sticky so didnt bother ordering anything on the up side the reception staff were really helpful and there is a large supermarket only a 5 minute walk awayadvantageslocation is unique as its away from crowded burdubai streetsspinneys hyper market is very close to hotel  opening 24hr which is very good for breakfast  buying daily stuffrooms are clean and beds are not badlcd screen with known branded is provided which is unexpected from such hotelhowever we didnt use most of the appliances but washing machine elec cooker microwave  kittle are more than enough for two persons guestdisadvantagesbreakfast buffet is very poor dont think about itvery bad smell from previous guests cooking which the hotel shouldnt make checkin to any guests till get rid of that smellstayed there in early jan 2015 the rooms are finethe hotel is walking distance from a 24 hrs supermarket and from where you also have an indian restaurant and a mc donaldif you like shoppingcentre point is walking distance and when we were there we really had some real discount dsf as compared to the big malls like dubai mall and marina mallyou can also have taxi easily once you are outside the hotel the hotel has a restaurant and you can order room service  otherwise stay was fine and the hotel is not far from the airportthe metro is not so far but still a little bit of walking is requireddubai mall is some 1015 mins by metrostayed here in january 2011 for 4 nights thought the hotel was clean friendly but our mattress was a bit poor and cheap other than thatthe location was a bit secluded the taxi drivers used to get confused so used to ask then to drop us off at burjaman centre and we used to walk it down at least spinnys was just 2 minutes away overall i most probably not go back only because i want somewhere more closer to the beach the breakfast was nice and very asain plus continental different everydaydue to medical procedures of me and my spouse and a prolonged stay we looked for a low priced but comfortable apartment reasonably near health care city the studio was adequate though a little claustrophobic with a tiny kitchen small bath and basic necessities we had bargained for internet included in our rate the hotel is near a spinneys market that has everything the owner and staff were very nice and taxis were easy to find on the street outside not much for atmosphere or view though (Score: 0.4938)\n",

            "small traditionally furnished room with desk and chifferobe and large modern bathroom not enough outlets but that is not unusual for older places notified hotel of early morning arrival 200300am and a receptionist was there to check us in it does not have immediate car access the guesthouse is a building behind street side restaurants difficult to connect to internet but with staff help wifi great loved being in the al fahidi historical area felt very safe in the area current photos are accuratei stayed here 3 nights in the beginning of april with a friend our room number was 9 big and clean and quitebreakfast is good the only minus point was the coffee it was instantthanks to lorena and the night guy  he helped us a lot in our last night because of our taxi thanks again i will definetely stay here again for the old city lovers and for the people who wants to feel like i am in orient this area is the best 1 minute away from dubai museum and 5 minutes to textile soukmy husband and i had actually booked and paid for another heritage area hotel the hotel barjeel heritage guest house but when we arrived in the evening after a very long and tiring flight we were told at that hotel that they were full  and they then called the orient guest house who agreed to send someone to come pick us up to spend our one night before our cruise at first we were both rather upset as we had planned far ahead to have an authentic arabian hotel experience and forgo the glitzy high rise hotels but when we saw our lovely arabian style room though small with its obvious antique firnishings the super comfortable king sized canopy bed and nice size bathroom we calmed down our room opened right onto the ground floor breakfast patio area and had an ancient thick giantsized wooden door with a huge old padlock the room was very quiet and we slept great  in the morning we enjoyed our breakfasts on the patio that we had ordered the night before we retired we even had some delicious dates with our meal i did wonder what the very thick bacon was slced from it had quite a different taste somehow we missed seeing the roof terrace although we saw other guests heading up the stairs and just thought they were going to higher floor guest rooms it would have been nice if the person checking us in the night before had mentioned it but it was getting quite late after breakfast we were amazed to discover that this hotel is located right in the heart of the heritage center and tour groups are walking all around that area we loved how close it is to the canal the dubai museum and so much more i would choose to stay here againthis is a really nice place to stay  and walking distance to the river and shops however  we did ask an airport pick up  which was not there i eventually spoke to a man at the hotel from the airport information desk he said he had an airport pick up for someone was i him i said i was not him he then said that he did not get an email requesting a pickup actually the request was part of my booking we arrived after a taxi fare of about aud80 it was about 11pm we were tired and it was very hot the man at squeezy reception was totally inefficient and seemed to be upset at the intrusion  he asked did we had our booking paper  i told him no because we had no way of printing it but i did have the details  he had a very unwelcoming maner he snorted to clear his throat coughed and mumbled and made some vague attempt to retrieve our booking on the computer eventually saying that without the paper it was impossible i asked if i could use the computer to retrieve the booking he agreed i showed him on the screen but he directed me to print it on the office printer he then took the printout and began the booking in process at this stage a younger smartly dressed man arrived from their other hotel across the street made room for us to sit down welcomed us to the hotel and offered us a cool drink we had been there close to an hour he then disappeared leaving us with the original man he gave us the corner room closest to the reception this had an air vent in the bathroom that went straight through to the reception area  which meant all sound and anything else travelled in either direction without any hindrance we asked for another room in the morning we were shown to another room i think there was only 1 other guest so plenty to choose from  by an absolute smiling joy of competence who was the young filipino woman that was responsible for guests breakfasts and room service she was lovely helpful and friendly nothing seemed too much trouble it was her alone that stopped us moving to another hotel i do hope this hotel make use of this review and allows the young woman to have a more responsible role with in this hotel  it would certainly benefit from her guest orientation one more thing  the entire cost for this 4 day stay was taken out of our account 4 days prior to our arrival not the usual process by the hotels we book through agodait was still very hot in dubai but this hotel is cozy arabian style very nice staff walking distance to the museum the river the old market 15 minutes to the metro station to go anywhere you want to exploremy sister and i stayed at the orient guest house for our one night transit stay in dubai it was lovely though a 15 minute cab ride to the heart of dubai such as the burj khalifa the oriental guest house provided a glimpse of what dubai was like years ago in a simpler life and it was nice the hotel itself was small and quiet clean and well decorated with rooms surrounding the lovely courtyard our beds were comfortable and the rooms well appointed with a nice shower and all the amenities that go with it the staff was eager to assist us both with our luggage as well as hailing a cab a delicious breakfast was included which featured fresh breads fresh squeezed juice and eggs made to order the orient guest house is in more of the historical district and close to the spice market though we did not have a chance to explore much but it was a welcome respite after driving through dubai with one skyscraper after another to find this quaint hotel at a reasonable price it was perfect for our one night stay and we would recommend it for stays in dubai as an alternative to the large resorts and huge hotels though perhaps for longer stays a pool or beach hotel would be welcomed that being said it couldnt have been niceri stayed at the orient this past week for two days and was very glad i did it had a great deal of character as compared to another chain hotel i was in previously and i very much appreciated its location  close to the al fahidi metro station and the creek within the very lovely bastakiya and close to great and inexpensive indian food they were also very accommodating holding my luggage as i went to meetings on my last day after checking out and even letting me freshen up in an unused room before i went off to the airport for a midnight flight i will definitely stay here again on a return to dubaia charming and very quiet hotel in heart of old dubai if you want to be away from high rises and crowds at least tourists this is the place for you walking distance 800 to 1600 meters from hotel are dubai museum river cruises goldtextile souk abra water taxi metro there are maybe 10 rooms in hotel the rooms are nice clean and traditional to give you a little taste of arabia the service and staff are friendly and good this is by no means intended to be a fancy bb it is more authentic simple and traditional if you are looking to get pampered this is not it my only beef is there are no windows in room but this is what you get for authentic feel yes the tv is old school but really are you there to watch tv inside your roomgreat im so happy to have stayed therei found the orient guest house a cosy and relaxing place for my 9days holidaythe traditional architecture and room interiors give a wonderful taste of old dubai my room was impeccably clean and nicely furnished like other rooms as long as i could see the courtyard was a quiet place where to read so as the terrace upstairs breakfast was not the 5 hotel continental one but still enough with little changes everyday i found the service clientoriented and the staff friendly and ready to help just english is not their strengthi would suggest this guest house to travelers who want discover dubai at 360 degreesclose to the guest house dubai museum old bastakiya quarter dubai creek hindi lane souks abra metro line 10 on footstylish tastefullydecorated rooms and a quiet comfortable central courtyard make this a relaxing place to start and end your day in dubai the bastakiya location is perfect unless hitting the malls is your thing beautiful strolls around the rebuilt old town 3 minutes to the dubai museum with easy walks to the creek the souks lots of local and south asianmediterranean restaurants and the metro the room was clean and importantly cool the staff was helpful if not overly attentive and responded promptly to all of my requests so many residences in dubai are luxury high rise hotelsthis is a welcome change of pace unless i have a particular business reason to stay some place else this will be my goto spot in dubai and when i visit on tourism ill definitely stay here againwe stayed 2 nights as a stopover in this guesthouse the rooms are very nice with big soft beds and a bathroom filled with nice soaps and shampoos the staff is friendly and at your service 247location wise its close to the airport old town and metro stationthe included breakfast is big and goodwe stayed for 2 nights in february and enjoyed our visit the staff were helpful and the breakfast was good our room was large and comfortable and opened onto the courtyard where breakfast was servedthe bathroom provided very nice toiletries although the bathroom fittings were rather old and on the first night the toilet wouldnt flush properlyi would recommend this hotel as it is a very pleasant change from all the modern hotels in the rest of dubaii was so glad that i stumbled on this place and spent two nights here this is a chic olddubai style guest house that is a stone throws from dubai museum and the textile souk it is located in the al fahidi historic district i had no regrets at all booking the place hot showers and working airconditioning with a very comfortable bed the breakfast was buffet styel and more than sufficient the price  it was a very good deal  well worth the money to top it off the staff were excellent and very accomodating to my requests my friend and i came in at 5am and they accomodated us in the majlis a room for us to rest and even agreed to change my friends breakfast to the first day he entertained my many other queries as well and was so very patient  thank you so much patric the lady at the reception lorena was also great and very helpful the hotel has no gym and pool but you can head over to their parent hotel the arabian courtyard hotel where you can use their facilities free of charge i would not hesitate to stay at the orient guest house again if i return to dubai and i highly recommend this place to anyone who want to explore a different side of dubaienjoy the pakistani restaurants barbers and supermarkets souks metro and abri station at walking distance lovely place visit the vivid malls and disney park beach resorts on a day trip and return to a more authentic historic middle east in the guest house special recommendation to enjoy breakfast at the pakistani restaurant near fahini metro station much more satisfying than the breakfast at the hotel have funif you are looking for something akin to a traditional arab riad then this may suitits located in old dubai very close to the dubai fort museum amongst a small medina of similar looking buildings and warren of alleys once you enter through the wooden doors it opens into a traditional courtyard with the rooms running off this and a smaller courtyard there is also an upper floor which is where we stayed this timenice outlook and there is a quite large upper deck where there are views out over the area and a place to chill if the weather is not too hot summer on dubai wouldnt be good up herewe stayed here several yeats ago and it hasnt changed at all in that timethe good points are its not an anonymous large hotel and gives an insight into how the locals live  we stayed in some mag nicest riads elsewhere in the middle east and north africa and orient is true to the style but certainly at the lower quality endits clean and comfortable although the rooms do vary a bit in size and even the larger ones are a bit cramped its nice to have breakfast in the courtyard and the breakfast on offer is ok without being outstanding staff are friendly and helpful and the location is good for doing some sightseeing that is off the beaten track  local cheap restaurants a nice walk along the dubai creek shoreline largish local souk selling textiles and a range of other stuff take a small boat across the creek to visit the gold souk on the other side dubai museumfortthe things that could be improved is the speed of the checkin which can be a bit slow the furnishing of the rooms trys to be faithful to antique look but it just comes across as old and a bit shabby and the room cleaning was left to very late in the day when wee turned around 6pm which caused a bit of inconvenienceall up its a nice enough place and we would probably book here again when next in dubaii personally loved the place its not a hotel  more of bed and breakfast the area around it makes you feel like youre in a different erathere were some few point i hope the managment would take care of improving the variety of breakfast youre paying as much as youre for a 4 stars hotel also room cleaning they just change bed sheets and towels  i saw a vacuum cleaner but i didnt see the dirt gone we had a plesant three night stay at orient guest house in the old part of town this is not the ritzy dubai most picture but we found it more interesting if very hot head out after dark when its cooler and grab some street food with the locals the room was clean enough though the headboard could certainly use a good dusting the shower had lovely pressure but a tendency to get all over the floor not uncommon at hotels ive stayed at outside the us breakfast was nice and filling and the staff was very sweet and accommodating air conditioning in the room was a god send in the sweltering heat a great choice of hotel if you are looking for a more down to earth stay the staff are so nice and helpful and friendly the rooms are comfortable and interestingly decorated loved the wooden furniture our visit was in august and i didnt realise how hot it would be in dubai maybe i would have picked a glitzy place if i had thought it through properly but then i think i would have missed out on something differentif you want to stay some unique place  this is the place located in the old dubai house rooms having quite interesting decoration high rooms small windows like a prison style the staff was quite tightlipped  nosmile but one person was very nice and was able to help us when we had some questions price was ok compared to another dubai hotel pricesstayed here for 4 nights and it was great really refreshing after the bling of downtown and marina areas of dubai we found the staff to be really friendly and helpful in fact i remarked on how nice the dates were at breakie and the next day she had bought me in a box of the same make as i could not get the in the local supermarket our room was one off the main courtyard had a massive four poster bedroom was good and i know some reviews have said rooms were dark but it is the style of the building so this is to be expected bathroom was adequet but we did get a bit of flooding when using the shower but it was clean some reviewers reviewers remarked on the doors but these doors are all in the traditional style and i have tosay that we did not feel hemmed in or too dark the bed was very comfy it was hard it suited is so we had great nights sleep the breakfast was adequet cold buffet and some hot eggs etc if you wanted this  i would defiantly come back again the next time in dubaigood location to discover the old dubaibut the staff is quite slow and not caring they suggested to swap my booking with a different location when i arrived i had chosen the hotel pickup upon booking i had to insist to stay therewe love staying in the old city and this guest house was a grand merchants house which has been converted into rooms based around a courtyard where breakfast is served the rooms have character yet still have the modern conveniences such as free wifi tv ensuite etc this is one of other guest houses in the same chain as the arabian courtyard hotel across the road from the museum which is where we had a lovely evening meal my one criticism is the way they have scrimped on staff we had one girl book us in that afternoon who unfortunately was not exactly welcoming and obviously had a blanket response to questions which didnt allow her any flexibility or imagination we had our booking form which clearly said breakfast was included but because her sheet said it wasnt she refused it it was up to us to ring the manager and run around to get it sorted next day we went to breakfast where there was an extremely competent and friendly young man who it turned out took your order cooked your breakfast cleared the tables and looked after the booking out and booking in of guests of all the historic hotels in that area this wouldnt be my first choice but if we got another good price then yes we would stay againif you are looking for a more authentic place to stay in bur dubai this is it no breakfast buffet or fancy reception but real personal attention from the friendly staff good fresh breakfast clean rooms although they are a bit outdated but on the other side that contributes to the charms of this hotel nearly every room is adjacent to a patio where you can enjoy the fresh air before you go to sleep dubai for me is rather over he top so it was nice to find something a little bit more to my taste just ten rooms simply furnished set around a courtyard the guest house is in a traffic free area so is quiet very comfy bed hot shower and good quality goodies in bathroom air con rather noisy but that maybe just the room i was instaff excellent breakfast goodthis hotel has a big sister a few minutes walk away the arabian court and guests can use the pool etc arabian court also has a very good restaurant easy walk to the creek where you can cross by abra to the souks and just ten minutes by taxi from the airportthis quaint guest house is actually located within the historical area of the al fahidi district right opposite the al musallah post office it is within walking distance if you wish from the al fahidi metro but a cheap and quick taxi ridethe rooms contain old traditional furniture the breakfast included in the tariff is delicious and it has character there are plenty of eateries nearby an abra trip across the creek from the gold and spice markets and a short walk to the textile market the atheryat center next to the arabian courtyard hotel in al fahidi st is also a great place to shop at reasonable prices negotiate of course but at least you dont feel ripped off given the start point is much lower than you will find at the marketstourist areas oils of perfume from grasse france is very reasonable and many well known names toothis guest house is situated in the old part of dubai we stayed in a small room off the main courtyard with a nice bathroom and decor we found the place to be quiet had a local flavor near some interesting restaurants and was in the middle of the bastakiya historical area the price was very reasonable for dubai and we appreciated having a local rather than big hotel experience the breakfast was an interesting mix of middle eastern and western foodthis guest house is super right in the historic centre a few steps from dubai museum and creek a nice area if you hire a car there is a free valet parking option good breakfast nice simple rooms with clean bathroom and clean bed staff have some english so are able to give advice is required breakfast is served in the airy court yardi would recommend this hotelthis is our second time to visit and it was as good as the previous visit our room this time was o the roof traditionally furnished with a beautiful carved wardrobe bed was very comfortable and good bathroom with plenty of hot water  turn on water heater though there is a roof terrace as well breakfasts were in the main courtyard and was average one step outside the courtyard and you were in the wonderfully historic labyrinth of narrow streets in old dubai so well located for walking to all the sites and the creek the metro was easy to locate and quick and cheap to use to get us to dubai mallfountains and the higherst building the light show was amazingits a converted courtyard house in a historical place in the old persian structure of dubai a small historic quarter of the city far removed from the glitz and glamour but close to all the important sitesroom and courtyard equipment could have been cleaner the staff is helpful and i appreciated their enabling me to have a late checkoutthe hotel is perfectly located in the historical part of dubai the building has a classic layout with two lovely courtyards and a rooftop the rooms have the comfortable size and so do the adjacent washrooms but everything needs better maintenance some update and better care to be truly pleasant the staff are nice and helpful but not very professional wearing dirty uniforms flipflops being noisy during the night the place cries for a professional manager onsite and there is the issue of finding the hotel the address is not precise it requires asking around and truly searching for the siteour room 1 was off the second courtyard with a little private seating area and was wonderfully quiet traditionally furnished with a beautiful carved wardrobe and wall hangings bed was very comfortable and good bathroom with plenty of hot water there is a roof terrace as well and one room at that level breakfasts were in the main courtyard and was good one step outside the courtyard and you were in the wonderfully historic labyrinth of narrow streets in old dubai so well located for walking to all the sites and the creek moses and the staff were very helpful and kindif you wanna try a different style of a house then visit this place it was rustic yet beautiful a place where you find quietness relaxing and surrounded by beautiful cafes the staff were accomodating and even allowed us to choose which room we want to 3 of us fit in one room not that big but it was fine clean and very organize room breakfast was great as well everything that we checked in the list were served definitely a must see placewe thank you very much for everything  glad and relaxed we will not forget sopleasant and astonishing place in the world  breath of dubai atmosphere andshowing us a lot of wonderful places worth visiting we hope to come back hereand encourage everybody to spend time and have a rest in such beautiful areanice hotel clean rooms fine breakfast friendly and smiling staff what else super cif you are looking for a change from expensive tourist traps and to have a need to experience a real arabic house stay with 24hr butler service this it and the price is amazing for dubai today i will be backvery interesting hotel for people which want to discovered arabian culture rooms are clean but small and very hot breakfast is normal butler service is very good location of hotel is good  10 min walk from metro 20 km from jumeirah beach the orient guest house is situtated in the al bastakiya area which is a beautifully recreated heritage area also known as the al fahidi historical neighbourhood it is quite close to the dubai museum and a 6 min walk to al fahidi metro station due to its location the guest house has a traditional heritage charm to it you enter into a courtyard and the reception office will be diagionally to your right they reallly have put a big effort into preserving the historic nature of the site with delightful old padlocks for the doors hardwood furniture and traditional decorationsthe complimentary breakfast was fairly typical of middle eastern fare with eggs fruit dates homus cream cheese flat bread however they also serve a rotation of turkey sausuage and turkey bacon the breakfast coffee is instant which was disappointing perhaps i am being a bit of a coffee snob herethe rooms decor was very nice however it did have a constant off smell to it that did not go away for the whole time we were therethe internet access didnt quite extend to our room but in the courtyard it was quite strong and fastthe staff were courteous and helpfupwe stayed 11 nights and we like it very much our rooms were nice and bigger than your average hotel rooms my bed was nice i like my bed little bit hard and i slept very well the courtyards were nice and quiet you were able to go roof terrace there is couple tables and chair to enjoy sun if there is only couple of other guest breakfast is served to table otherwise there is buffet table and is pretty good staff were nice and helpful house is old but renovated in old style location was excellent for us the metro was close and bus station was about 1 km away 15 minutes walk from there you were able to take bus number 8 2016 december and go to differed beaches we had busmetro card which we bought from metro station and for longer stay it was very goodorient guest house is a huge disappointment and absolutely not value for money on arrival i was allocated a windowless box of a room and refused to accept it the drably furnished and painted room i ended up with was disappointing the bed had two mean hard pillows one tiny cake of soap was provided in the bathroom  which didnt even last a weekend  and in the bathroom the shower curtain clings to you water leaks out all over the floor soaking the bath mat and the grouting was peeing off the bath in a long snakelike strip there was no room service or cleaning at all the reason given was i was supposed to hand in my key to reception only was not told this apparently there are no spare keys for the cleaners hard to believe the very high price did not even include breakfast but that was no loss it was a super cheap looking buffet the hotel is in a great location but is no better than a 3star and worth only half the price at best  id say 70 max  until the service is substantially upgraded it is owned by the arabian courtyard hotel just up the road which is a much better option ive stayed there a few times and always liked it but if you want something with an arabic ambience go next door to the beautiful xva hotel orient really needs to clean itself up until then stay away for the price i feel hugely cheatedexcellent location this place is quirky comfortable clean and quiet the rooms are traditionally decorated some are quite small but very pleasant breakfast is also included in the tariff there are restaurants across the road the metro is about 500 mts away the museum 300 mts dubai creek 200mts fabric souk 200 mts the sister hotel arabian plaza has massages etc and is about 200 mts awaywe have stayed here before and it was just as good second time aroundi didnt take enough notice that this is only a guest house not a hotel no bar lobby pool or restaurantits in the old town heritage district yes  but its not a tourist district so its not nearby to anywhere else youd want to visitif you were an older couple staying for one or two nights then this place would be greatthe staff are wonderful and theres free wifinot really suitable for anyone young not younger western couples or families or anyone staying more than a couple of nights no where really to sit and relax that isnt extremely hot room service is a longgg wait and not available 247book through hotels combined and can get a decent rate  however the rack rate is far over priced for what its worth dont book through amoma which advertised a twin room when actually there is no twin room in the placenice arabian theme and far away from any of the glitz and glamour room so overcrowded with furniture though and couldnt get cold water but i hear thats standard in uae in auguststaff were always so friendly and helpfulnice cafe and tea room adjoining metro about 600m away consulates very closegood place to stay away from the high rise hotels able to walk down to the creek and to restaurants safe if you are on your own arabian tea house a minute walk away for eveining meals good to be able to sit outside in the courtyard for breakfast which is adeqaute but could be improved staff very friendly good place for a stopover stay in dubaiwe stayed 3 nights at the guest house would of loved to have stayed longer we could walk everywhere to the creek museumsouk restaurants awesome coffee museum and arabian tea shop breakfast was basic but served in a courtyard bed was a bit hard the staff friendly but helpful can be tricky to find as its behind the arabian tea shop and not a large sign taxi can pull up in front of the tea shop next time we will try there other guest house on the creek dubai thats tall skyscrapers and modern buildings everywhere some of them display a stunning architecture some of them are openly unimaginative and some are already a little bit dilapidated however there are just a few blocks where you can get an impression of bygone times the whole area consists of a reconstruction of typical local architecture including the famous windcatchers to ventilate the houses of course it feels a tiny little bit like disneyland but its still nice to pretendthe hotel stays true to the philosophy of makebelieve and decorates the rooms accordingly enhanced with modern accomplishments the city centre is nearby and owing to the secluded design there is almost noise from the streets except fro the muezzin if you want luxury and modern achievements stay somewhere else if you want a heritage hotel this is just your placewe booked one room for a four night stay for my parents and one room for a two night stay for my partner and ia week or so before our stay my father was informed that there had to be maintenance work done in a few rooms and that they would have to move my parents into a different hotel after informing them that this would be inconvenient as we had another room at the hotel they asked if they could move us as wellwe checked out the other hotel and said it would be find but asked for a compensation as the hotel that they wanted to move us to was 30 euros a night cheaper than the hotel we originally bookedthey ended up moving us to the other hotel but informed us that we had already paid for our stay and wouldnt be reimbursed at all please remember this was a two night stay and a four night stay at a 30  difference a night leading up to a difference of 180   then they let us know that we could cancel the booking with the original hotel we booked but we wouldnt be able to get the payment back that we already made which was the full amount for the stay so that didnt make any sense eitherwe didnt get an apology or any reimbursement at all so please do not book this hotel it was a bad experience a terrible start for our vacation and led to a lot of confusion and annoyance before we even got therewe stayed here for several nights to explore dubai nice area located in the historical district as you can easily stroll around a ways off from the malls for heavy shoppers nothing fancy but not expensive either it can work for getting a few nights in this part of townbuck the trend stay in the museum quarter of old dubaidubai is so so modern and built up andthis is a quiet oasis in the very very old citythere were only a couple of other guests when we stayed  it deserves betterquietest hotel ive ever stayed inthe location in the calm historical rebuilt bastakiya district is certainly one of the nicest and most authentic ones one can get in dubai  for those who do not want to opt for the flashy modern parts of the city however you will get much much better quality hotels in dubai for the same pricethe hotel as such has seen better days all is a bit wornout bathroom facilities are not up to the mark rooms are dark and dingy and could also be cleaner breakfast is bb level if you think of coming in your own car add 20minutes for arrival and for departure as there is no parking available and valet services are run by a nearby bigger hotel the mothership of orient guest housei had a great time here beautiful room nice people quiet good breakfast bastakiya is wonderful especially during sikka artweek nice restaurants metro museum busstation bus tour abu dhabi abras hop on hop off bus alle on walking distance the only thing i did not like is that employees never had a day off ik stayed for 12 days and they were there everyday the guest house is right in the al fahidi historical neighbourhood  old name was the bastikiya quarter and you couldnt ask for a better location for the local souks the creek and the history of dubai is right here the accommodation is top value service is polite and smiling this is for those who want plenty to do in walking distance nd easy on the pocket thats hard to find in dubai good price clean fantastic ambience delicious breakfast bad point is no cold wateryou have to take your shower late night or early morning close to dubai museum takes around 45 aed to dubai mall by ubergreat when looking for something other than a hotel in dubai the guest house is located in a cool part of old dubai and close to the water and is quiet the staff were friendly although they wouldnt let us check in early without paying an extra 150 aed 40 usd even though there appeared to be only one or two other guests in the whole place and we were checking out at 6am the next day they could do a better job of accommodating the guests that do choose to stay at the guest house but overall id recommend this over one of the many standard samesame hotels in dubairoom amenities as usual nothing special guest house only for quite place and old fashion heritage house lovers good room only bathtub available and water heater small room only for couples so here in guest house no twin beds recommended for peace old dubai loversim not a big fan of the glitz of new dubai feels cheap and skindeep i really enjoyed my short stay great rooftop terrace friendly and helpful staff and i really enjoyed my room felt more exotic than it really was some decent falafel shops nearby toomy wife and i stayed here recently for 3 nights on arrival we opted for an early check in and were able to choose a room due to a number available opting for one on the upper floor we more or less had the upper terrace to ourselves as all other guests seemed to be in ground floor rooms the room itself was spacious well air conditioned and with a large modernized bathroom some of the furniture and fittings were a bit tired but they all worked and were comfortable breakfast is plentiful and served in the main courtyard after you have made your choices the nights before staff are pretty friendly and offer good customer service with the night staff seemingly being more helpful especially when needing help to find taxis and get things done the guest house doesnt have a poolspa but you are able to use one at the sister hotel less than 10 minutes walk away opposite the dubai museum which is worth a visit in front of the guest house is a great little tea house which has a refreshing mint and lime juice on the menu as well as some tasty lunches next to that a cafe that specializing in dishes with camel meat  we tried the house special and really enjoyed it though portions are very large so take your appetite taxis can be easily caught from outside and the hop on hop off tourist bus stops outside the dubai museum around the corner about 25aed to the dubai mall and 45aed to the mall of the emirates we had one issue when on the last evening before a very late check due to a 2am flight out our air con started leaking with water going everywhere and became unusable the night butler was happy to move us straight away to another room so we could shower change and pack our bags before leaving for our flight a charming place to stay in the throng of old dubai much cheaper than the high rise luxury hotels will be happy to stay again (Score: 0.4739)\n",

            "on arriving at the hotel i received a warm welcome and met the front of reception manager stephen desouza he was very helpful and welcoming the english pub the locker room was excellent with very tasty food and reasonably priced beers it also had a very good atmosphere in there with many people playing pool and darts breakfast  this was ok with a reasonable but limited selection from the buffet for westerners the room itself was comfortable and appointed as you would expect  the bed was very comfortable and i slept very well there is also free underground car parking which was

paid represents fantastic value for money for a convenience one night stay the room was mainly clean and well presented the staff were all universally friendly pleasant and efficient in this area i cant imagine a better choice in terms of value for money the hotel is within walking distance of the metro and there is enough shade for this to be done even in early summer months taxis are easy to find outside there is also free underground parking but the entrance is not easy to spot as it is not well signed at the roadthe breakfast was standard for the uae in this type of hotel but certainly not bad service was friendly and the food freshmy only complaint is that i requested a nonsmoking room and although there was a small plastic sign on the table in the room to identify the room as such the room smelled very much of stale cigarette smoke so much so that my shirt left to hang over night smelled of smoke when i put it on in the morning not sure whether this was smells through the ac or older usage of the room but this would prevent me as a neversmoker staying longeri cant tell that this hotel is good because i had a bad experience since i reachedwhen i booked my room i could chose double bed or two single beds so if they allow you to chose it is because they have both options and they will book for you the one you chose we reached the hotel and the guy in the reception said us that they didntt have avaliable a room with double bed i said him that i didnt understand it because i booked specifically this bed and it was avaliablethe answer was the hotel is full today but i will compensate you with a upgraded bedroom we will join the beds and it will be like a big bedi said him that i was really disapointed because they shoud book the correct bed for us or dont give us that option if it was not avaliable for me one bedroom 5 square meters bigger is not a compensation in this casehe said us that the next day we would change the room to the one we booked lower level but with the big bed i explained him that it would be a waste of time and really unconfortable for us because we would have to pack again everything and move he said that we would have to proceed like this he didnt try to fix the situation in a better way simply with 5 square meters the first night and changing the room making us to move everything again then i wanted to keep a claim and the guy didnt allow me incrediblethen we went to the room we were waiting while one guy was joining the beds my husband expected something different in the way to join the beds to make them same as a double bed but they simply kept the beds beside each other even one was little higher than the otherone my husband called to the receptcion and he asked for the manager dutty time they informed us we cutted the call and after 1 minute they called back it was more than 130am and on theory someone cancelled a room just that moment and exactly the room that we booked same level same bed come on we changed the bedroom so we went to sleep after 200am on the other hand the room we got was neat and confortable only the smell was little bad like moisture about the breakfast we tasted a cake and small muffins which were really hard not fresh there were some kind of bread of lot of days before same with the cheese slicesthe croisants and napolitanas were fresh fruits they offer watermelon and melon and fruit saladtwo kind of cheese and turkey two kind of cerealscold mezza and some hot things like sausages boild eggs french toasts you can eat toasts but only with jam or honey i didnt see butter nor nutella or chocolate the location is good but arround the hotel you have to pay for the parking not too much but you have to save coins for it summarize they have to improve the organisation the way in which they solve the problems the smell in the rooms and take care about the things i mentioned in the breackfast too much thingsi want to say thank you very much to the hospitable staff of golden tulip we like the receptioniststhe restaurant hoststhe managers we turned for helpeverybody we liked breakfaststhey are tasty indeed we want to thank the cleaner of our room 219 who did it every morning i think i will be back to golden tulip again and will recommend it to my friends thank you very much againthe checkin wasnt quick a tall guy probably syrian nationality on the reception just forgot about guests who were sitting and waiting for his response when i just told him about ourselves he said sorry and didnt notice us as he was talking on the mobile phone laughing and nicely discussing something personal call he was very rude and didnt payed attention how to talk when we got to the room we recieved complimentary fruits due to a long checkin later on recieved a call for an additional payment as was mentioned it was for a security deposit it was very weird for a hotel and it wasnt mentioned on a booking when i was about to pay i had to go down as their machine was broken same guy said that we need to move to another room cause they have maintanence so we had to pack again for a moving the light in a room was broken furtinture was a bit dirty but the food was nice i wouldnt suggest that place staff have to leard how to talk with the customerslast weekend i stayed at the golden tulip hotel everything exceeded my expectation from the arrival to the check out everything is perfectrooms are clean specious comfortable the team at the reception were amazing and so professional surely i will stay at the golden tulip hotel whenever i am in dubaihave been travelling to dubai for almost 10 years for business this had to be the worst hotel i have ever stayed at 1 charged 170 dirham for airport collection car was a dirty toyota dropped off in the golden tulip bus with a driver that thought he was a racing driver save your money and get collected from a normal taxi at half the price 2 hotel staff were rude unhelpful and not professional 3 air fresher throughout the lobby and lift that stinks 4 ac unit noise i switched it off and open the window 4 breakfast is disgusting sausages are cheap and processed 5 they only serve filtered coffee for breakfast that is so nasty you cant drink it i asked for a cappuccino and was told there would be charge for it 6 the hotel was full of tourists from a particular region in central asian this is not i repeat not a hotel for business travelers or travelers from western northern central and southern european 7 used the pool upstairs is was dirty with broken tiles sauna changing rooms had broken toilets very poor hygiene 8 bathroom in room was dirty  mold in shower area and broken tiles 9towels were hard excessive use you would get better conditions staying at a cheap motel travel lodge on the freeway 10 could not meet clients or potential clients at the hotel as it was embarrassment i held meetings at the holiday inn around the corner 11 this is not a 4 star hotel very far from it 12 very dated decor i ended up getting an upset stomach after 3 days stay and came home with a throat infectiongreat place to stay for the business traveller convenient for both dubai and abu dhabi

compact breakfast area6 small root top pool7 away from heart of dubaioverall a good budgeted staybooked for this property for 5 days only but because of superb customer services provided by shihab ami lyn aziz and nita decided to extend for 2 more days this is a budget hotel but it did not matter since the front desk fb and even the house keeping provided warm accommodation to me please recognized the hard work of shihab ami lyn and nita even all the pilipino staff from the house keeping from they are warm and lovely i will book back from this hotel if chances permitpoor bar with indifferent staff there are much better bars locally for just a 10 minute taxi ride to barsha heights dont waste your time here ive lived in dubai over 6 years and for some reason bars in al barsha have a poor standard of service for some reasonworst hotel i have ever stayed upon checkin nobody opened the door for us as they were busy with phone upon checkin receptionist was so rude whereas lady duty manager was so polite and offered upgrade to suite room during winters pool was not heated so we had to leave as it was very cold we ordered food from room service the portion was very generous with reasonable prices breakfast not really nice not many options and staff was only focusing on clearing the tables rather than focusing on service staff has poor knowledge we went to the bar and asked the waitress to put the bill in the room as we were inhouse guest and we had deposit she replied that they only accept cash or credit card overall very bad experience first and last time poor hospitality no enough staff i have to carry my luggage by myself and then i was surprised that they dont even have valet had to park my car when i was booking it says with breakfast after i paid and i went to the reception they said no its excluded i was really disappointed with everything all i know is that i ll never go there againwent to this hotel in september and it was actually better than i thought it would be the room given was spacious and clean they have a nice rooftop pool which is quiet good for relaxing the beds are comfortable giving you a good nights sleep there wasnt much noise from the locker room or the sports bar the morningafternoon staff are wonderful especially lyn shes wonderful if you need anything she will help you out no problem and actually seems like she wants to help you and make things better possibly the best receptionist ive ever come across the breakfast could do with more variety however it was good enough for my stay also the breakfast staff are lovely and polite they have a 5gb wifi limit per device max 2 in your room which i thought ran out alot quicker than 5gb usually would however i got this reset by speaking to the reception the late eveningearly morning staff are terrible honestly if you have a problem wait till the morning they are unhelpful so rude and act like they own the hotel one of the receptionist faizan tried to do me over and make me seem like i was dumb but when i returned with email evidence from the hotel he had no choice but to sort the problem out for meanyways apart from the problem with the late eveningearly morning staff evening else was perfectly fine its a very good location so close to the metro too would definitely stay againall staff at the reception ewas very helpful and understand our expectation the hotel has always lift problem every time maybe because the management changed and no action takenwe complain to reception but they cant do anythingi stayed in this hotel for 5 days i met ali at the front desk at my check in and he was very friendly the male staff especially at the front desk are very friendly mostly the ones available when i get there room service and house keeping on point i visited during ramadan so prices were very pleasing definitely going back when i visit dubai this hotel has the rudest most unprofessional staff i have ever encoutered very poor customer service the way the respond to the slightest of requests is terrible and their managers are always busy and in meetings so they never attend to customers queriesthe facilities are very poor tooall in all i would highly recommend not staying here or bothering as there is a wealth of better and cheaper options in dubaifriendly staff good experience and a cool place to hangout with friends at the bar easy access to the hotel and good service at the bar makes it another place to keep visiting for drinks and just meet upsvery friendly front desk staff especially big thanks to a receptionist faizan very helpfulhotel is nicecleannear to metrosome staff should be trained such as housekeeping other than that all is fine like 5 star check in and check out service is very slow felt that not enough staff at the reception however the room is very clean and tidy provide bath room amenities hotel has 1 all day dining restaurent call fresh locker room  sports bar and 1 korean restaurent we met savio diaz he take care us with warm hospitality thank you so much everyone who make our stay wonderful i paid to stay for 7 nights but i had to cancel the last night due to flight travel i paid with my credit card and was told i would be refunded as i am speaking this is one month later that i left dubai and golden tulip albarsha has not refunded my money they even dont respond to my mails anymore i am shockedamaizing experience i visited this hotel and stayed in room 202 it was amazing experience the room was goodlocation is excellent near metro station i would recommend this hotel and will definitely go back myselfi am very thankful to mrfaizan and anil both guys provided wonderful servicesthough the hotel doesnt have the facilities and the amenities of a 5 star hotel  nevertheless it has a superb team  excellent customer service and warm attitude  you really feel that you are home away from home  a great location in barsha area  with self parking facility  few nice outlets  a korean restaurant and a bar plus a nice cozy restaurant with a great breakfast  a hotel with a real value for money outstanding staff especially the first encounter with the hotel reservation agent  ms amy   rooms are clean and spacious  a real great experience they book the hotel in amount but they charged extra and they dont able to explain why they charge extra big thieve in dubaii ask them to provide calculations how they charge this amount but they didnt tell anything and just said contact to website from where you booked i have email available with invoice they sent to me once i booked the hotel and actual bill which hotel charge extrawe were welcomed by a very nice polite professional duty manager mr gurleen singh at reception check in mr singh was very helpful from start to end of our stays and was always at hand for any advise and help we stayed 6 knights in a lovely upgraded room  with all the facilitys for self catering as well  our room was lovely and clean  air conditioning was perfectly set to temperature location was perfect near dg metro station  we had booked bed and breakfast  breakfast was not great at all we found it to be lacking taste badly and very small sitting area  but the waiter a china man was great  all the staff were very good helping with luggage  and keeping our room cleaned with all the facilities  swimming pool on roof was lovely and clean and swim pool attendant very helpful with sun beds  clean towels provided each time location is good near sharaf dg metro stationroom size is goodstaff is goodrestaurant serves indian breakfast as wellthere is peculiar smell which comes in lift and parking which can be worked uponregards garima056 4991910good and clean place wonderful breakfast but this room very very small for all the people than stay in this hotelperfect position near the metro stop and 10 min walking to dubai mallif hotel widens this room can be 5 stars in tripadvisori booked this hotel for three from bookingcom for 150 they left dirty glasses in my room after cleaning the room  i complained at front desk the indian guy at front desk was very rude next day it happened again i mentioned to young and tall indian  he said just sorry and they will replace it  which it didnt happened i booked this hotel from bookingcom with 84 rate the hotel seemed good at the beginning but they booked me in a room with broken ac and blocked sink in the bathroom when reported that they started sending me workers to fix the problems asked for another room and it was dirty with diffused lights hose keeping was awful dirty and never clean properly had to complain daily to clean the room the good thing about this hotel is quite and smells good all the time the parking was a junkyard i dont advise anyone to book at this hoteli really would not know where to start i have never seen such horrible staff tayab tharu anil eman and the gm of the hotel mr irshad  i cannot convey strongly enough how disgusting this place and the unprofessional manager is  the management was worst enough  how this hotel is rated as 4 star seeing this bad services its not capable of giving 1 star hotel as well  you will find some comfortable hotel on this value of money very disappointed in the service  dont stay in this absolute dump of hotel i found a cats paw in my pillow cover  very bad experience  recommend to stay to the near hotel cosmopolitian hotel we are very pleased with the staff work professionally quick checkin and quick checkout careful attitude from the rest daily cleaning of the room tasty breakfast the delux room was very nice and even had ironing equipment and a balcony excellent location  close to the metro station there are plenty of shops supermarkets and restaurants in the area and it is quiet and peaceful i recommendgood if youre there for a few nights had no issues checking in although the breakfast bouffet didnt have much varietyhad to cut my trip due to unforeseen circumstances it would have been nice to get a refund for the night i couldnt stay but yeah all in all it was goodthe hotel facilities require urgent maintenance bathroom flush was malfunctioning from time to time and the water pressure is very poor difficult to regulate the air conditioningthe staff is excellent and do their best to make your stay comfortable despite the shortcomings mentioned above special mention should be made of the receptionist tharu room service person at night restaurant staff and the door mangreat hotel near metro station and very accessible employees are very polite and approachable specially mr faizan and ms eman  it was such a memorable stay for us  thanks to them the only thing i can suggest is that they should extend the pool timing as 6pm onward is a great time to swim _stayed here for 2 nights in nov 2018 chosen because of location near to grand millenium hotel which has a couple of very good bars rooms were of an average size but clean and well appointed all in all the hotel is in very good condition rooms attractive and decent bathrooms including a large walk in shower complete with large rain shower head beds and pillows were very good extremely comfortable pool area is a bit small but we still managed to grab two loungers but only just pool is for chilling only not big enough to do any lengths free breakfast which was adequate not great but enough choice for most peopleworst hotel ive stayed in  it wasnt easy to check in in this hotel  more than 5 hours waiting from 12 noon without any excuse no manager to take a decision in this hotel  no safety deposit boxes in rooms no sob toilet in the lobby it looks like staff toilet  hot water constantly running out in my room  no ventilation in the bathroom  balcony are closed also window or any extractor fan leaving the bathroom misty after taking a shower and leaving it smelly extremely difficult to communicate with hindi language  beds were uncomfortable we slept on the floor   pillows were solid hurting your neck when you sleep with hair and stain  room was dust central the dust had settled everywhere and even after us wiping it off with some baby wipes it would resettle under the bed was filthy with dirt and dust looked like it had been forgotten about by the cleaner  bed sheets were filled with dust when we asked boy saying no staff only 1 in the floor if we could have them changed he replied well the cleaner has finished very bad whos going to do it  fridge was dirty and horrible and the bottom of it was rusty  staff funny when you leave hotel to eat or drink out i could go on but out going to waste any more time i have honestly never been anywhere and met such rude staff in the desk i dont wanna give this hotel any stars but i cant post without 1 star this place shouldnt pop up in any hotel searches its like the bermuda triangle only concierge and mr florintino very helpfuli found a really good deal during ramadanthe hotel is in the centre of al barsha and a good location for metro linereception team are good and there was one morrocan lady in the restaurant who gave great servicerooms are so poor and there is ladies of the night everywhere in the hotel from the bar and walking through the corridors knocking on the doorsthe worst part of my stay was the attitude of the night manager mohamed i have never seen worse customer service in my life and a very poor attitude i wrote to the gm and he never replied i also checked him on linkedin and he seems to be a marketing guy not a hotelier post everyday on linkedin without responding to his guests  poor showworst guest service ever facedshame to mrfaizan as being an front office attendant had worst guest handling skillspoor attitudenot recommended for any guest who looking for good hospitality and genuine staffworse hotel we have ever stayed instaff were horrible tooalso no hot water to have a shower either through out our stay  they lied to us and we have been told maintanance

appreciate the service thank youas management consultant i travel a lot and i have seen many hotels in dubai this one is exceptionally bad for the reasons listed below1 their free internet is incredibly slow you will barely manage to update your email or run google search for the decent internet they charge money 50 aed per day absolutely unacceptable for business travelers 2 room cleaning is horrendous i found things that belonged to previous guest and during room cleaning they did not change my bed sheets or provided second towel 3 they do not provide basic necessities that every hotel has like toothbrushes or soap bars4 water in the hotel is barely warm  the weather outside during my stay 37 degree so this was really surprising 5 hotel is extremely old  facilities are outdated and i found mold in my room it is unsanitary6 during my stay the only treadmill in the hotel was in nonworking condition 7 when i tried to escalate all these issues to the management the hotel staff ignored me for 5 days until i complained to dtaoverall  do not waste money for this hotel there are so many amazing options for the same rate in dubai  do not spoil your holidaysthe rooms are bad first room was dusty and difficult to breath in and the bed had a mouldy smell second room was better but the toilet was bad the shower and flush water were very weakdont visit this hotel its not same picture all location in hotel not goodmassage at night customer not family place  stay at novotel nearby better went to the locker room bar it is clear that is a spurs bar so make sure you know that if its a match night good friendly bar staff and a decent variety of drinks if you are a spurs fan it rocks on match night (Score: 0.4705)\n",
